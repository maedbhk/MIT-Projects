Cerebellum is at adult volume in females during 7-11 years but not males (Caviness et al. 1996). \n* Males are particularly vulnerable to neurodevelopmental disorders (diagnosed at a higher rate with adhd, dyslexia etc). \n\nTo what extent are disorders characterized by Healthy Brains accompanied by RDoC-like constructs and domains? How is cognitive function measured? [behavioral tasks or questionnaires]. \n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["../include-files.lua","quarto"],"css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"cerebellum-development.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.38","theme":{"light":"cosmo","dark":["cosmo","../theme-dark.scss"]},"code-background":true,"code-copy":true,"title":"Cerebellum and Development"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
