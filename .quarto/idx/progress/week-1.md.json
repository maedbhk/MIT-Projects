Talked with Hoda about UK Biobank, will meet in person soon. Need to contact Steve and/or Debbie (have not met them yet). \nAvailable info on UK Biobank and ABCD is pretty comprehensive, need more details about CHOP (will know more when I get access).\n* Have been reading the precision medicine literature, familiarizing myself more with recent developments in the field\n* Plan on compiling a set of papers relating to neuroethics that I think will be pertinent to future projects (especially CHOP-related project) \n\n## Software/Tools\n* [Datalad](https://neurohackademy.org/course/data-management-for-neuroimaging-with-datalad/)\n    * how many datasets are currently hosted on datalad? \n* [Openmind](https://openmind.mit.edu/)\n    * got an account + took the course. I've used slurm a lot previously (used savio cluster at berkeley and I'm familiar with submitting jobs, running bash scripts etc.\n* [Singularity](https://apptainer.org/user-docs/3.8/index.html)\n    * are there any general-use singularity containers on openmind for common neuroimaging preprocessing?
