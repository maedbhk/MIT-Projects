Specifically, I used task-based fMRI data to build predictive models of the\ncerebellum, with the goal of understanding its role in cognitive function. I primarily used\nneuroimaging methods and techniques to build these models, however, along the way, I\nrecognized the utility of incorporating other modalities, namely transcriptomics, behavior,\nand neuropsychology to address my research questions. For example, I worked with gene\nsamples from the Allen Human Brain Atlas, and although the data were sparse for the\ncerebellum, it allowed me to imagine another lens by which I could investigate cerebellar\nfunctional organization. I was also involved in two patient studies that were particularly\nimpactful for me. Both projects were collaborations between multiple research groups\ninvested in testing a novel theory of cerebellar function. In multiple experiments, we tested\npatients with cerebellar degeneration (e.g. spinocerebellar ataxia) on a series of tightly\ncontrolled behavioral experiments instead of simple clinical batteries. It was my first\nexperience interacting with patient populations for the purposes of scientific research, and it\nmotivated me to seriously consider the potential of translating basic science research,\nacross multiple modalities, into patient-centered healthcare outcomes.\n<br>\nI am excited at the prospect of pursuing an ICoN computational fellowship in the\nGhosh and Gabrieli research groups for multiple reasons. First, regardless of where my\ncareer takes me, I am keen to use the expertise I cultivated during my PhD to work on\nlarge-scale and innovative projects that exist at the intersection of health sciences,\ntechnology, and data science. Second, I am eager to work in a highly collaborative\nenvironment under the leadership of ICoN center faculty members. One of the appeals of\nthe fellowship is that there are very clear overall objectives that are shared across the\nfaculty, research scientists, and postdocs, all of whom are contributing unique skill sets and\nexpertise to the work. Third, I will have the opportunity to extensively build my knowledge\nacross a wide range of areas: clinical assessment, endophenotyping, advanced machine\nlearning models, and cross-integration of multiple modalities (e.g. behavior, transcriptomics,\nneuroimaging, video/speech analysis). \n<br>\nFinally, it is an exciting time to work in precision\nmedicine, and although there is an abundance of data and computing power, what is lacking\nare models of individual human behavior that can inform risk predictors of health. Therefore,\nthe prospect of working in collaboration with the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia is\nincredibly compelling as it facilitates the development of behavioral tests whilst\nsimultaneously evaluating diagnostic models in a continuous fashion. Importantly, any\ncollaboration with clinicians will keep patient wellbeing at the forefront of our work.\n\n## Project Goals\nOne of the goals of the Ghosh/Gabrieli lab is to develop biologically-driven \nrisk predictors and monitors of mental health. This will be done using multi-modal\ndatasets that correlate genetic information with clinical evaluations through endophenotypes\nlearned from neuroimaging, behavior, actigraphy signals and speech/vocal recordings.\nMental health disorders encompass an enormous landscape of behavioral symptoms\nand clinical assessment. To start, I would be interested in narrowing the scope to a set of\nsymptoms that can be assessed across multiple modalities. Perserverative behavior is a\nsymptom that underlies numerous mental health disorders, including ADHD, OCD, autism,\nand schizophrenia, and it is measurable via multiple modalities. For example, perseveration\nhas been studied using fMRI and is thought to be the consequence of frontal failure to\nmodulate striatal outputs during controlled, purposive action, resulting in the continued\nreselection of previously activated outputs (Shallice, 1988). Another modality that has been\nused to study preservation is behavior. Cognitive tasks including the Wisconsin Card\nSorting task and the Trail Making task, have been leveraged to study perseveration in\ntypical and atypical development (Benitz et al. 2016). More recently, novel tools have been\ndeveloped that automate the labeling of effector movement, gaze, and facial expression in\nreal time using technology like deeplabcut and mediapipe. This technology could potentially\nallow us to identify perseverative behaviors across adult and developmental populations. It\nis possible to imagine combining live and longitudinal information from large-scale video\nand speech datasets to build prognostic computational models that identify and predict\nperseverative behaviors across a large range of mental health disorders. Furthermore,\nbased on what we already know from neuroimaging and behavior, we could validate these\nmodels using biologically-driven data that include large-scale networks of the cortex and\nsubcortex, and behavioral variation.\n<br>\nIn the context of this project, I am particularly interested in the following questions (posed in\nthe original proposal):\n\n* Considering the practicalities of precision healthcare, should we expect\nneuroimaging data to be incorporated into every individual’s health care\nassessment? To what extent does brain imaging even improve prognostic\napplications? Large scale cortical and subcortical networks have provided us\nwith valuable insights about brain organization and topography in both\nhealthy and patient populations, however, it is not clear what role these data\nwill play in diagnostic applications. Will we be able to reliably identify macro\ncircuits that drive behavioral (and genetic) variation? And if so, will we be able\nto use these circuits to inform predictive and diagnostic models of mental\nillness?\n\n* How good are behavioral assessments? Are there cognitive tasks that better\ncapture symptoms compared to self-report clinical questionnaires. This is a\nquestion that we have been exploring in the motor world, specifically in the\ncontext of identifying cognitive impairments in patients with cerebellar\ndegeneration. Subtle deficits are often masked by self-report questionnaires,\nand are then only revealed in carefully controlled behavioral experiments that\ntest very specific cognitive processes.\n\n* I also believe there is great scope to automate the analysis of human\nbehavior to aid psychiatric diagnoses. Some of this work is already underway\nin the motor world (e.g., automating clinical assessment of spinocerebellar\nataxia and Parkinson’s disease). I can imagine building models that identify\nsymptoms of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g.,\nperseveration, hyperfocus, task switching etc.) on continuous and longitudinal\nvideo data collected in naturalistic settings. These models of complex\nbehavior could then be validated by biologically-driven data and used to\ninform clinical tools that are then adopted by healthcare professionals.\n\n## Other considerations\n* Finally, there are a number of ethical considerations that I would like to consider as I\nventure into the realm of precision medicine. Translational work is a new area of research\nfor me and I am aware that precision medicine is a quickly evolving field that raises\nimportant questions about ethical responsibility:\n* Data privacy: Who stands to benefit, and who is harmed? What possible solutions\nhelp protect individuals’ and communities’ ownership over their own data? I think this\nquestion is especially relevant for neural data that is not (as of yet) being used to\ntrack, manipulate, or identify individuals.\n* AI and healthcare: with such heavy reliance on technology in developed nations, I\nthink it’ll be important to consider the concerns associated with bias and morality of\nAI, and how it may actually challenge equitable access to healthcare.\n* Communicating uncertainty: How do we communicate uncertainty about our\ntranslational results, especially when models are continuously updated with new\ninformation. It’ll be important to understand the uncertainty arising from technical\nprocedures: small/incomplete sample sizes, sparse longitudinal datasets, instrument\nvariability etc.\n* To what extent can we engage with diverse communities in translating neuroscience\nresearch to the health space. Can we bring together neuroscientists, physicians,\nethicists, engineers, mental health workers, and caregivers to understand the ethical\nimpact of data- and model-driven precision medicine?"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["../include-files.lua","quarto"],"css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"week-0.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.38","theme":{"light":"cosmo","dark":["cosmo","../theme-dark.scss"]},"code-background":true,"code-copy":true,"title":"Week 0"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
