To start, I would be interested in narrowing the scope to a set of\nsymptoms that can be assessed across multiple modalities. Perserverative behavior is a\nsymptom that underlies numerous mental health disorders, including ADHD, OCD, autism,\nand schizophrenia, and it is measurable via multiple modalities. For example, perseveration\nhas been studied using fMRI and is thought to be the consequence of frontal failure to\nmodulate striatal outputs during controlled, purposive action, resulting in the continued\nreselection of previously activated outputs (Shallice, 1988). Another modality that has been\nused to study preservation is behavior. Cognitive tasks including the Wisconsin Card\nSorting task and the Trail Making task, have been leveraged to study perseveration in\ntypical and atypical development (Benitz et al. 2016). More recently, novel tools have been\ndeveloped that automate the labeling of effector movement, gaze, and facial expression in\nreal time using technology like deeplabcut and mediapipe. This technology could potentially\nallow us to identify perseverative behaviors across adult and developmental populations. It\nis possible to imagine combining live and longitudinal information from large-scale video\nand speech datasets to build prognostic computational models that identify and predict\nperseverative behaviors across a large range of mental health disorders.

To what extent does brain imaging even improve prognostic\napplications? Large scale cortical and subcortical networks have provided us\nwith valuable insights about brain organization and topography in both\nhealthy and patient populations, however, it is not clear what role these data\nwill play in diagnostic applications. Will we be able to reliably identify macro\ncircuits that drive behavioral (and genetic) variation? And if so, will we be able\nto use these circuits to inform predictive and diagnostic models of mental\nillness?\n\n* How good are behavioral assessments? Are there cognitive tasks that better\ncapture symptoms compared to self-report clinical questionnaires. This is a\nquestion that we have been exploring in the motor world, specifically in the\ncontext of identifying cognitive impairments in patients with cerebellar\ndegeneration. Subtle deficits are often masked by self-report questionnaires,\nand are then only revealed in carefully controlled behavioral experiments that\ntest very specific cognitive processes.\n\n* I also believe there is great scope to automate the analysis of human\nbehavior to aid psychiatric diagnoses. Some of this work is already underway\nin the motor world (e.g., automating clinical assessment of spinocerebellar\nataxia and Parkinson’s disease). I can imagine building models that identify\nsymptoms of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g.,\nperseveration, hyperfocus, task switching etc.) on continuous and longitudinal\nvideo data collected in naturalistic settings. These models of complex\nbehavior could then be validated by biologically-driven data and used to\ninform clinical tools that are then adopted by healthcare professionals.\n\n## Other considerations\n* Finally, there are a number of ethical considerations that I would like to consider as I\nventure into the realm of precision medicine. Translational work is a new area of research\nfor me and I am aware that precision medicine is a quickly evolving field that raises\nimportant questions about ethical responsibility:\n* Data privacy: Who stands to benefit, and who is harmed? What possible solutions\nhelp protect individuals’ and communities’ ownership over their own data? I think this\nquestion is especially relevant for neural data that is not (as of yet) being used to\ntrack, manipulate, or identify individuals.\n* AI and healthcare: with such heavy reliance on technology in developed nations, I\nthink it’ll be important to consider the concerns associated with bias and morality of\nAI, and how it may actually challenge equitable access to healthcare.\n* Communicating uncertainty: How do we communicate uncertainty about our\ntranslational results, especially when models are continuously updated with new\ninformation.
