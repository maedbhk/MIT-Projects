If not, have we at least learned something interesting about the brain with this question?  \n\n## Project Ideas\n* 1) can unique cerebellar fingerprints dissociate neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, above and beyond what would be expected from cortical fingerprints? I think I'd be first interested in analyzing the structural data before addressing functional connectivity\n* 2) inspired by RDoC, can we use topic models (e.g., latent dirichlet allocation) to identify latent clinical characteristics derived from HBN behavioral and/or cognitive measures (e.g., positive and negative affect scale, GRIT scale, Wechsler intelligence scale) with the goal of providing individualized risk assessments. \n* 3) If we can identify groups/clusters by modeling behavioral/cognitive characteristics, can we identify corresponding dissociable neural signatures (whole-brain, not necessarily cerebellum-focused)? \n* 4) Relative to the neocortex, are there differences across disorders in neural signatures/fingerprints from early childhood to adolescence? For example, in developmental disorders (e.g., adhd, autism) do we see more significant changes in cerebellum (as indexed by reduction in grey matter) during early childhood relative to corresponding changes in the neocortex.
