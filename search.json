    "text": "The projects that I undertook during my PhD were aligned with the goals of basic science research. Specifically, I used task-based fMRI data to build predictive models of the cerebellum, with the goal of understanding its role in cognitive function. I primarily used neuroimaging methods and techniques to build these models, however, along the way, I recognized the utility of incorporating other modalities, namely transcriptomics, behavior, and neuropsychology to address my research questions. For example, I worked with gene samples from the Allen Human Brain Atlas, and although the data were sparse for the cerebellum, it allowed me to imagine another lens by which I could investigate cerebellar functional organization. I was also involved in two patient studies that were particularly impactful for me. Both projects were collaborations between multiple research groups invested in testing a novel theory of cerebellar function. In multiple experiments, we tested patients with cerebellar degeneration (e.g. spinocerebellar ataxia) on a series of tightly controlled behavioral experiments instead of simple clinical batteries. It was my first experience interacting with patient populations for the purposes of scientific research, and it motivated me to seriously consider the potential of translating basic science research, across multiple modalities, into patient-centered healthcare outcomes.  I am excited at the prospect of pursuing an ICoN computational fellowship in the Ghosh and Gabrieli research groups for multiple reasons. First, regardless of where my career takes me, I am keen to use the expertise I cultivated during my PhD to work on large-scale and innovative projects that exist at the intersection of health sciences, technology, and data science. Second, I am eager to work in a highly collaborative environment under the leadership of ICoN center faculty members. One of the appeals of the fellowship is that there are very clear overall objectives that are shared across the faculty, research scientists, and postdocs, all of whom are contributing unique skill sets and expertise to the work. Third, I will have the opportunity to extensively build my knowledge across a wide range of areas: clinical assessment, endophenotyping, advanced machine learning models, and cross-integration of multiple modalities (e.g. behavior, transcriptomics, neuroimaging, video/speech analysis).  Finally, it is an exciting time to work in precision medicine, and although there is an abundance of data and computing power, what is lacking are models of individual human behavior that can inform risk predictors of health. Therefore, the prospect of working in collaboration with the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia is incredibly compelling as it facilitates the development of behavioral tests whilst simultaneously evaluating diagnostic models in a continuous fashion. Importantly, any collaboration with clinicians will keep patient wellbeing at the forefront of our work."

    "section": "Project Goals",
    "text": "Project Goals\nOne of the goals of the Ghosh/Gabrieli lab is to develop biologically-driven risk predictors and monitors of mental health. This will be done using multi-modal datasets that correlate genetic information with clinical evaluations through endophenotypes learned from neuroimaging, behavior, actigraphy signals and speech/vocal recordings. Mental health disorders encompass an enormous landscape of behavioral symptoms and clinical assessment. To start, I would be interested in narrowing the scope to a set of symptoms that can be assessed across multiple modalities. Perserverative behavior is a symptom that underlies numerous mental health disorders, including ADHD, OCD, autism, and schizophrenia, and it is measurable via multiple modalities. For example, perseveration has been studied using fMRI and is thought to be the consequence of frontal failure to modulate striatal outputs during controlled, purposive action, resulting in the continued reselection of previously activated outputs (Shallice, 1988). Another modality that has been used to study preservation is behavior. Cognitive tasks including the Wisconsin Card Sorting task and the Trail Making task, have been leveraged to study perseveration in typical and atypical development (Benitz et al. 2016). More recently, novel tools have been developed that automate the labeling of effector movement, gaze, and facial expression in real time using technology like deeplabcut and mediapipe. This technology could potentially allow us to identify perseverative behaviors across adult and developmental populations. It is possible to imagine combining live and longitudinal information from large-scale video and speech datasets to build prognostic computational models that identify and predict perseverative behaviors across a large range of mental health disorders. Furthermore, based on what we already know from neuroimaging and behavior, we could validate these models using biologically-driven data that include large-scale networks of the cortex and subcortex, and behavioral variation.  In the context of this project, I am particularly interested in the following questions (posed in the original proposal):\n\nConsidering the practicalities of precision healthcare, should we expect neuroimaging data to be incorporated into every individual’s health care assessment? To what extent does brain imaging even improve prognostic applications? Large scale cortical and subcortical networks have provided us with valuable insights about brain organization and topography in both healthy and patient populations, however, it is not clear what role these data will play in diagnostic applications. Will we be able to reliably identify macro circuits that drive behavioral (and genetic) variation? And if so, will we be able to use these circuits to inform predictive and diagnostic models of mental illness?\nHow good are behavioral assessments? Are there cognitive tasks that better capture symptoms compared to self-report clinical questionnaires. This is a question that we have been exploring in the motor world, specifically in the context of identifying cognitive impairments in patients with cerebellar degeneration. Subtle deficits are often masked by self-report questionnaires, and are then only revealed in carefully controlled behavioral experiments that test very specific cognitive processes.\nI also believe there is great scope to automate the analysis of human behavior to aid psychiatric diagnoses. Some of this work is already underway in the motor world (e.g., automating clinical assessment of spinocerebellar ataxia and Parkinson’s disease). I can imagine building models that identify symptoms of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., perseveration, hyperfocus, task switching etc.) on continuous and longitudinal video data collected in naturalistic settings. These models of complex behavior could then be validated by biologically-driven data and used to inform clinical tools that are then adopted by healthcare professionals."

Translational work is a new area of research for me and I am aware that precision medicine is a quickly evolving field that raises important questions about ethical responsibility:\nData privacy: Who stands to benefit, and who is harmed? What possible solutions help protect individuals’ and communities’ ownership over their own data? I think this question is especially relevant for neural data that is not (as of yet) being used to track, manipulate, or identify individuals.\nAI and healthcare: with such heavy reliance on technology in developed nations, I think it’ll be important to consider the concerns associated with bias and morality of AI, and how it may actually challenge equitable access to healthcare.\nCommunicating uncertainty: How do we communicate uncertainty about our translational results, especially when models are continuously updated with new information. It’ll be important to understand the uncertainty arising from technical procedures: small/incomplete sample sizes, sparse longitudinal datasets, instrument variability etc.\nTo what extent can we engage with diverse communities in translating neuroscience research to the health space. Can we bring together neuroscientists, physicians, ethicists, engineers, mental health workers, and caregivers to understand the ethical impact of data- and model-driven precision medicine?"

Two RAs are starting next week and I will be giving them both projects that focus on building phenotypic models while I turn my attention to neuroimaging.

Both of these structures have a protracted development, and any dysfunction or dysregulation in this connectivity during critical developmental periods likely contriubtes to symptoms underlying a host of disorders. There are also sex differences in the maturation of PFC and cerebellum, and it would be interesting to test whether connectivity differences emerge at different developmental stages across males and females.\nI’ve also been continuing literature review for the CHOP project and I’m eager to get access to the data so that we can explore relevent questions.\nOnboarded the first of three RAs, here is the onboarding document I have put together."

    "text": "There has been great interest recently in the idea of the cerebellum as a locus in neurodevelopmental disorders. Structural and functional abnormalities in the cerebellum are consistently reported across neurodevelopmental disorders, and in particular, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been linked to cerebellar abnormality. For example, children and adults with ASD show atypical fMRI activation of cortico-cerebellar networks during biological motion perception Jack et al. 2017 and perception of social interaction Kana et al. 2015. Furthermore, behavioral studies have found that children with ASD display abnormal conditioned reponses in delayed eyeblink conditioning, a conditioning paradigm that strongly implicates the cerebellum. For example, Tran et al. 2017 tested delayed eyeblink conditioning, a task which is depenedent on the cerebellum, on a group of very preterm children and adults. They found that in this group, there were significant deficits in the acquisition of conditioned responses, therefore suggesting that both motor and non-motor behavioral deficits arise from cerebellar abnormalities.\nOne of the primary reasons why we think of the cerebellum as being an important developmental structure is that it is among the first brain structures to begin cellular differentiation and one of the last to fully mature Sathyanesan et al. 2019. Specifically, while the majority of neocortical neurogenesis occurs prenatally Silbereis et al. 2016, cerebellar neurogenesis continues until the 11th postnatal month Abraham et al. 2001. During this period, the cerebellum undergoes enormous growth, quadrupling in volume between the 24th and 38th gestational weeks Volpe et al. 2009, and then it doubles in size during the first 90 postnatal days. In fact, 85% of granule cells, the most populous cell type in the cerebellum, are generated after birth Kiessling et al. 2013. Given its protracted development, the cerebellum is especially vulnerable to a host of insults from environmental and molecular, to genetic and epigenetic factors Sathyanesan et al. 2019. Studies of preterm infants have shown that cerebellar injury during the perinatal period results in volume reduction in both cerebellar grey and white matter as well as remote neocortical regions Limperopoulos et al. (2014). These results suggest that changes in early cerebellar activity affect both cerebellar development and activity of neocortex, which means that the cerebellum could play an important role in refining cortical circuits during critical develpmental periods Wang et al. 2014."

    "title": "Ethical Considerations for pHealth",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Much of the points below came from a review paper by MacEachern and Forkert (2020)\n\n\nML approaches require large amounts of data, therefore data will be collected from many locations and transferred to a central location for storage and processing. essential that the datasets do not contain patient-identifying information. in the future, this could be overcome using distributed machine learning approaches (e.g., travelling ML model) - trains locally on the available data, before moving to the next center with available data Tuladhar et al. 2020\nML models as “black boxes”, especially with increased complexity of the input data. this raises legal and ethical questions as clinicians and other researchers may not fully understand how an ML model came to a particular conclusion about a patient’s health.\nAs physicians can be held legally responsible for their decisions, error in ML models is of course a concern. Who is responsible for an error induced in an ML model? These tools (for the time being) will support and assist physicians in making decisions about patient care, they are not yet designed to operate autonomously.\nThere are technical limitations to ML models, which is that these models are only as good as the data on which they were trained. However, these training datasets are often inherently noisy and biased. What this means is that models are being created that cannot generalize to more diverse test sets (other regions, diseases, demographics). The easiest way to avoid this problem is to increase the training set and include a diversity of samples, however, this often has logistical (e.g., privacy) challenges.\nFinancial cost is another major concern with pHealth, which will lead to disparities in access to care based on SES. Also, in-depth workups can lead to unintended consequences such as incidental findings that may lead to further testing, which may be invasive and unnecessary, inducing patient stress in the face of diagnostic uncertainty.\nCommunicating uncertainty. there is rarely a clear-cut answer in science, our interpretations operate on probability and likelihood. communicating uncertainty to scientists and non-scientists alike is challenging, especially when decisions are being made that will influence a person’s healthcare outcomes. Therefore, it is important that future machine learning models can identify the most important clinical features for a specific clinical question so that unnecessary assessments can be avoided, maximizing benefit and minimizing harm to patients.\nBias in datasets is one of the most pressing concerns for pHealth. bias can come about due to patient selection, affecting the accuracy and generalizability of the model. Additionally, the financial and practical aspects of implementing pHealth limits the models primarily to the developed world, excluding those in the developing world from the analyses, and any benefits that are offered.\nA yet unanswered question is whether discoveries made by pHealth will have individual impacts on human behavior with respect to disease prevention. For example, if a patient knows that they are at risk for heart disease based on underlying genetic or epigenetic factors, will they change their behavior? Also, it’s possible that such discoveries will create “patients-in-waiting” who are not yet sick but have been identified as high risk."

For example a study by Clementz et al. 2016 grouped patients with psychosis intro three transdiagnostic biotypes based on neuropsychology and EEG data, and another study by Drysdale et al. 2016 used resting state functional connectivity (rs-FC) to group patients with depression into 4 biotypes, based on differential responsiveness to transcranial magnetic stimulation.\nModels are also built with the goal of customizing treatment based on individual brain markers: this endeavour is central to pHealth. For example: studies using brain measures to predict who will respond to a particular treatment can identify brain biotypes useful for guiding treatment."

The authors hypothesize that the persistence of the external granule layer past 20 postnatal months lead to the development of medulloblastomas (tumors that affect the cerebellum in children). Typically the EGL disappears first in the vermis and then later in the hemispheres.\nEarly postnatal development is also characterized by massive outgrowth of dendrites and axons, followed by synaptogenesis, glial proliferation, and myelination, predominately in the forebrain and cerebellum.\ndevelopmental disruption resulting in cerebellar atrophy could affect cerebello-cortical connectivity.\nthe synapse is an effective point of functional comparison between neocortex and cerebellum. many neurodevelopmental disorders involve deficits in synapse formation, maturation, and function.\n\na typical pyramidal cell in the neocortex has approx 8,000 synapses, whereas a single Purkinje cell may have 200,000 synapses.\nreduced number of synapses are characteristic of many neurodevelopmental disorders\nwe now know that granule cells encode rich sensory information, therefore, synaptic deficits in PCs likely correlate with sensory processing deficits in neurodevelopmental disorders."

These results suggest that changes in early cerebellar activity affect both cerebellar development and activity of neocortex.\nIt’s also possible that coordinated deficits in the cerebellum and cortex could arise due to a common molecular and/or environmental insult rather than co-dependence between structures.\nthe cerebellum is also implicated in downs syndrome - which is the most prevelent developmental disability with a known genetic origin. People with DS have smaller total cerebellar volumes, smaller frontal and temporal lobes and smaller hippocampal volumes. Similar to ASD, white matter structural changes are also observed in the adult DS brain.\n\nEvidence from Behavior\n\nin people with obvious ‘non-motor’ behavioral abnormalities, do ‘pure’ motor cerebellar abnormalities exist? For example, Tran et al. 2017 tested delayed eyeblink conditioning, a task which is depenedent on the cerebellum, on a group of very preterm children and adults. They found that in this group, there were significant deficits in the acquisition of conditioned responses, therefore suggesting that ‘motor’ cerebellar behavioral abnormalities coexist with non-motor abnormalities.\nchildren with ASD also display abnormal conditioned responses in the eyeblink conditioning paradigm\nit has been suggested that the language and social deficits observed in children with complex disorders are a consequence of deficits in multi-sensory integration.\none particular process that could be implicated in multisensory integration in children with ASD is timing. For example, this process may be impacted by a deficit in perceiving the temporal relationship between distinct sensory components of complex audio-visual stimuli such as language, and this deficit could also compound in social cognitive processes like theory of mind Stevenensen et al. 2014\n\nInter-regional morphogenesis\n\ninterestingly, the cerebellum and the thalamus initiate neuronal differentiation at about the same time - E10.5 Wong et al. 2018\ngiven their common neurogenic timetables, one could speculate that extensive connectivity and matching of developmental trajectories could indicate that early defects in the cerebellum might lead to structural and wiring alterations in the thalamus.\nit has been suggested that the cerebellum could interact its cortical targets using developmental cues that ‘match up’ regions of connectivity: with the goal of establishing a precise topography between subregions of the cerebellar nuclei and subnuclei of the thalamus."
