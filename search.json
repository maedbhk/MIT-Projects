It uncovers high-quality relationships between medical concepts, as judged by physicians.\nunstructured, high-dimensional and sparse information such as clinical notes are difficult to use in clinical machine learning models.\nClinical notes contain significant clinical value, compared to structured features, clinical notes provide a richer picture of the patient since they describe symptoms, reasons for diagnoses, radiology results, daily activities and patient history. Problem: for time-stretched physicians (example: thosyoue working in intensive unit) can’t digest/compile all of the information presented across EHR, therefore, the question is: can a model do it for them?\nUtility of clinicalBERT: actively predicting readmission has clinical significance, as it may improve efficiency and reduce the burden on intensive care unit doctors.\nClinicalBERT has developed a discharge support model that processes patient notes and dynamically assigns a risk score of whether the patient will be readmitted wtihin 30 days.\nClinicalBERT can also be adapted to other tasks such as diagnosis prediction, mortality risk estimation, and length-of-stay assessment."

    "text": "Done\n\nWrote a predictive modeling pipeline using scikit-learn tools (and repurposing code I had written for previous projects). Worked reasonably well at doing basic model predictions on the HBN dataset. However, I explored pydra-ml, realized it was a lot better than what I had written, and decided to transition to using some of its functionality. My pipeline, for example, did not allow for model comparison as elegantly as pydra-ml. I was having difficulty doing preprocessing (using scikit-learn’s ColumnTransformer) within the framework and ended up trying to debug pydra-ml. This then led me down many hours of exploring (and learning) how to navigate pydra (not wasted time - I learned a lot).\nI also spent a lot of time on feature engineering this week, which I always forget (along with data cleaning, transformation etc.) takes more time than anticipated. .\nI have yet to incorporate jupyter notebooks into quarto framework (which I believe is possible) so I can’t share any of the initial prediction results here. Some of the questions I’ve addressed:\n\nWithin HBN assessment battery, which tests are most useful? (how does this vary across disorders?)\ncan further subtyping of individuals be done based on patterns in behavioral/cognitive assessments? (especially for 200 people who were not diagnosed due to an incomplete evaluation)\n\nI tested python implementation of SUIT on subset (n=10) of hbn participants (T1w + T2). There are still a few bugs to be ironed out in the python library (that don’t exist in matlab) - I will touch base with Joern about this in the next few days if I don’t figure it out myself. As we discussed in our last meeting, there are also deep learning approaches that are comparable (if not better) at isolating and segmenting the cerebellum. I haven’t investigated these approaches much but it might be necessary if we are analyzing cerebella of &gt;3000 participants, and if SUIT is not reliable.\nWrote an ad for two research assistants and circulated broadly (including UROP), have yet to receive any applications so likely that I will need to cast the net more widely.\n\n\n\nTo Do\n\nTry UMap in supervised mode to identify unique patterns in phenotypic data\n\nwhat is the reliability in the KSADS assessment across child and parent measures?\n\nPerform VBM to measure local changes in structural abnormalities, following methods steps implemented in this paper - correcting for brain size etc.\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\nReached out to folks at HBN about getting LORIS access but haven’t heard from them yet. I’m analyzing the data from Openmind which I believe is up-to-date. I have access to all of the phenotypic data and I’ve been able to analyze some of the anatomical data that’s on OpenMind so I don’t think I’m missing anything, but would be nice to have full access so that I can stay current with any changes or updates.\nI’ve scheduled a meeting for next Wednesday to discuss some of the results from HBN and to talk about the CHOP project before our meeting with the Philadelphia group."

    "section": "Project Goals",
    "text": "Project Goals\nOne of the goals of the Ghosh/Gabrieli lab is to develop biologically-driven risk predictors and monitors of mental health. This will be done using multi-modal datasets that correlate genetic information with clinical evaluations through endophenotypes learned from neuroimaging, behavior, actigraphy signals and speech/vocal recordings. Mental health disorders encompass an enormous landscape of behavioral symptoms and clinical assessment. To start, I would be interested in narrowing the scope to a set of symptoms that can be assessed across multiple modalities. Perserverative behavior is a symptom that underlies numerous mental health disorders, including ADHD, OCD, autism, and schizophrenia, and it is measurable via multiple modalities. For example, perseveration has been studied using fMRI and is thought to be the consequence of frontal failure to modulate striatal outputs during controlled, purposive action, resulting in the continued reselection of previously activated outputs (Shallice, 1988). Another modality that has been used to study preservation is behavior. Cognitive tasks including the Wisconsin Card Sorting task and the Trail Making task, have been leveraged to study perseveration in typical and atypical development (Benitz et al. 2016). More recently, novel tools have been developed that automate the labeling of effector movement, gaze, and facial expression in real time using technology like deeplabcut and mediapipe. This technology could potentially allow us to identify perseverative behaviors across adult and developmental populations. It is possible to imagine combining live and longitudinal information from large-scale video and speech datasets to build prognostic computational models that identify and predict perseverative behaviors across a large range of mental health disorders. Furthermore, based on what we already know from neuroimaging and behavior, we could validate these models using biologically-driven data that include large-scale networks of the cortex and subcortex, and behavioral variation.  In the context of this project, I am particularly interested in the following questions (posed in the original proposal):\n\nConsidering the practicalities of precision healthcare, should we expect neuroimaging data to be incorporated into every individual’s health care assessment? To what extent does brain imaging even improve prognostic applications? Large scale cortical and subcortical networks have provided us with valuable insights about brain organization and topography in both healthy and patient populations, however, it is not clear what role these data will play in diagnostic applications. Will we be able to reliably identify macro circuits that drive behavioral (and genetic) variation? And if so, will we be able to use these circuits to inform predictive and diagnostic models of mental illness?\nHow good are behavioral assessments? Are there cognitive tasks that better capture symptoms compared to self-report clinical questionnaires. This is a question that we have been exploring in the motor world, specifically in the context of identifying cognitive impairments in patients with cerebellar degeneration. Subtle deficits are often masked by self-report questionnaires, and are then only revealed in carefully controlled behavioral experiments that test very specific cognitive processes.\nI also believe there is great scope to automate the analysis of human behavior to aid psychiatric diagnoses. Some of this work is already underway in the motor world (e.g., automating clinical assessment of spinocerebellar ataxia and Parkinson’s disease). I can imagine building models that identify symptoms of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., perseveration, hyperfocus, task switching etc.) on continuous and longitudinal video data collected in naturalistic settings. These models of complex behavior could then be validated by biologically-driven data and used to inform clinical tools that are then adopted by healthcare professionals."

Translational work is a new area of research for me and I am aware that precision medicine is a quickly evolving field that raises important questions about ethical responsibility:\nData privacy: Who stands to benefit, and who is harmed? What possible solutions help protect individuals’ and communities’ ownership over their own data? I think this question is especially relevant for neural data that is not (as of yet) being used to track, manipulate, or identify individuals.\nAI and healthcare: with such heavy reliance on technology in developed nations, I think it’ll be important to consider the concerns associated with bias and morality of AI, and how it may actually challenge equitable access to healthcare.\nCommunicating uncertainty: How do we communicate uncertainty about our translational results, especially when models are continuously updated with new information. It’ll be important to understand the uncertainty arising from technical procedures: small/incomplete sample sizes, sparse longitudinal datasets, instrument variability etc.\nTo what extent can we engage with diverse communities in translating neuroscience research to the health space. Can we bring together neuroscientists, physicians, ethicists, engineers, mental health workers, and caregivers to understand the ethical impact of data- and model-driven precision medicine?"

I think I’d be first interested in analyzing the structural data before addressing functional connectivity\n\n\ninspired by RDoC, can we use topic models (e.g., latent dirichlet allocation) to identify latent clinical characteristics derived from HBN behavioral and/or cognitive measures (e.g., positive and negative affect scale, GRIT scale, Wechsler intelligence scale) with the goal of providing individualized risk assessments.\n\n\nIf we can identify groups/clusters by modeling behavioral/cognitive characteristics, can we identify corresponding dissociable neural signatures (whole-brain, not necessarily cerebellum-focused)?\n\n\nRelative to the neocortex, are there differences across disorders in neural signatures/fingerprints from early childhood to adolescence? For example, in developmental disorders (e.g., adhd, autism) do we see more significant changes in cerebellum (as indexed by reduction in grey matter) during early childhood relative to corresponding changes in the neocortex.\n\n\nNext steps: - Once I get access to HBN, I want to do a summary analysis of the phenotypic assessment data to determine the scope of the data (e.g., do some power analyses) - If it seems like there is a sufficient sample and enough complete behavioral measurements, I’ll likely plan on testing cerebellar isolation and segmentation of a few pilot participants (not clear to me yet what technical challenges we may face using SUIT on a developmental dataset). - test some topic models on the HBN phenotypic assessment data - I plan on publishing the website today at some stage so I’ll slack you the link, hopefully that will be an easier way to get a sense of what I’m working on"

A simple demographic model (features: sex, age) is not successful at predicting either of these measures, although there is a significant relationship between diagnosis and sex. Language tasks do reasonably well at predicting whether a participant has been diagnosed with a disorder or not (compared to physiologic function for example). It also seems, tentatively, that language tasks do better at predicting certain disorders, notably autism, however, I haven’t done significant testing yet.\nTechnical challenges: I am doing the preprocessing step before I run pydra-ml, there were some challenges in passing ColumnTransformer to the pipeline separately for both numeric and categorical data. I also would like to incorporate another step in pydra-ml that allows for model comparison (features + classifiers). Currently, one filename is passed in (one set of features) + multiple classifiers and model comparison is done on one set of features.\nTried UMap in supervised mode to identify unique patterns in phenotypic data\nIroned out some bugs in SUITPy for isolation and segmentation and tested it on a small subset of the HBN (across developmental stages). Each participant takes ~ 25 minutes and adds &lt; 1GB of storage. Have yet to extend this analysis to &gt;10 participants of HBN, will need to talk to Dorota/Hoda about space allocation on OpenMind, perhaps will do batch analysis.\nInterviewed UROP candidates for two positions, recruited one student from Wellesley to work on research methods, and have to decide between three great MIT candidates for a computational position.\n\n\n\nTo Do\n\nquestions to answer: what is the reliability in the KSADS assessment across child and parent measures? meant to get to this question during the week but didn’t have time.\nPerform VBM to measure local changes in structural abnormalities, following methods steps implemented in this paper - correcting for brain size etc.\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\nIs there anything that I should do in advance of the CHOP meeting on Monday?\nWhat is the protocol for storing new analyses (SUITPy output) on &gt;2000 participants?

This role requires strong computational/programming expertise. At a minimum, the candidate should be very familiar with Jupyter Notebooks, pandas, numpy, Github. Candidates who have machine learning experience including natural language processing (e.g., SentenceTransformers) and unsupervised learning (e.g., UMAP) are preferred. However, an interest in learning more about these methods is also highly desirable.”\n\nHad a productive meeting with Kseniia from Arno’s research group. She’s working on similar questions and we discussed potential collaborations, specifically wrt to the item analysis and subtype work. She sent me a link to a csv containing item names (linking HBN questions to question keys – a possible solution to the chaotic data dictionarie problem I was encountering). However, there are still some small bugs to be ironed out so spent some time programmatically fixing the csv so that it is more versatile for our purposes.\nTalked with Jeff about running “The Script” on HBN participants. I’m going to take the lead on this for now. I have written another script to do SUIT processing on these data but haven’t tested it at scale, spent some time trying to borrow from Dorota’s script to inform SUIT script.\nFinished running a bunch of HBN models that now incorporate demographic variables: race, ethnicity, sex, age – notebooks available soon (waiting for last model to finish)\n\nWhile I have been running models separately for each measure (across many diagnoses and target variables: diagnosis, sex), Shreya has been running larger models (throwing in all features) and testing out different classifiers"

Preprocessing of ABCD phenotypic data\nThursday: spent the day at the Picower conference “social and environmental determinants of child mental health”\n\nreally fascinating conference bringing together a diverse group of speakers: environmental epidemiologists, clinical psychologists, native american scholars. Notes here\nconnected with Ran Rotem - he gave great talk on environmental epidemiology and big data: using EHR to infer environmental contributors to autism (focus on hypothryoidism). I’m interested in the approach (and the datasets) with a specific focus on cerebellar injury during prenatal stage or first 3 months post-partum and later diagnosis of ASD.\n\nFriday: Mostly meetings today + continuing to preprocess ABCD data"

Can this be identified using geocoded data?\n\nWhat is the scope/granularity of the geocoded data collected by CHOP?\nCan the model that we build on CHOP data be generalized to adolescents in other geographical locations? For example, are there similar risk predictors for suicide in Philadelphia compared to Boston?\n\nWas COVID-19 a risk factor of suicide attempt?\n\nCan we quantify the risk that COVID presented to a population at-risk for suicide? Were suicide risk predictors different as a result of the pandemic?\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Outline\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\nOne idea for modeling the data is to use clinicalBERT, which models clinical notes to predict hospital readmission. This approach is largely focused on unstructured data, therefore it should be applied to electronic health records that contain text data, which are high-dimensional and sparse.\nTo model structured data, we could use any number of machine learning pipelines. We are using pydra-ml for another project, which is a lightweight and flexible machine learning pipeline that does predictive (and interpretable) modeling.\n\n\n\nEthical considerations\n\nNot only are there methodological considerations for anyone doing predictive modeling work in psychiatry, but there are significant ethical considerations. As we progress in this project, I hope to be mindful of these points and to include them in our discussions wherever possible."

Structural and functional abnormalities in the cerebellum are consistently reported across neurodevelopmental disorders, and in particular, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been linked to cerebellar abnormality. For example, children and adults with ASD show atypical fMRI activation of cortico-cerebellar networks during biological motion perception Jack et al. 2017 and perception of social interaction Kana et al. 2015. Furthermore, behavioral studies have found that children with ASD display abnormal conditioned reponses in delayed eyeblink conditioning, a conditioning paradigm that strongly implicates the cerebellum. For example, Tran et al. 2017 tested delayed eyeblink conditioning, a task which is depenedent on the cerebellum, on a group of very preterm children and adults. They found that in this group, there were significant deficits in the acquisition of conditioned responses, therefore suggesting that both motor and non-motor behavioral deficits arise from cerebellar abnormalities.\nOne of the primary reasons why we think of the cerebellum as being an important developmental structure is that it is among the first brain structures to begin cellular differentiation and one of the last to fully mature Sathyanesan et al. 2019. Specifically, while the majority of neocortical neurogenesis occurs prenatally Silbereis et al. 2016, cerebellar neurogenesis continues until the 11th postnatal month Abraham et al. 2001. During this period, the cerebellum undergoes enormous growth, quadrupling in volume between the 24th and 38th gestational weeks Volpe et al. 2009, and then it doubles in size during the first 90 postnatal days. In fact, 85% of granule cells, the most populous cell type in the cerebellum, are generated after birth Kiessling et al. 2013. Given its protracted development, the cerebellum is especially vulnerable to a host of insults from environmental and molecular, to genetic and epigenetic factors Sathyanesan et al. 2019. Studies of preterm infants have shown that cerebellar injury during the perinatal period results in volume reduction in both cerebellar grey and white matter as well as remote neocortical regions Limperopoulos et al. (2014). These results suggest that changes in early cerebellar activity affect both cerebellar development and activity of neocortex, which means that the cerebellum could play an important role in refining cortical circuits during critical develpmental periods Wang et al. 2014.\n\n\n\nPlanned Analyses"

For example a study by Clementz et al. 2016 grouped patients with psychosis intro three transdiagnostic biotypes based on neuropsychology and EEG data, and another study by Drysdale et al. 2016 used resting state functional connectivity (rs-FC) to group patients with depression into 4 biotypes, based on differential responsiveness to transcranial magnetic stimulation.\nModels are also built with the goal of customizing treatment based on individual brain markers: this endeavour is central to pHealth. For example: studies using brain measures to predict who will respond to a particular treatment can identify brain biotypes useful for guiding treatment."

Cerebellum is at adult volume in females during 7-11 years but not males (Caviness et al. 1996).\nMales are particularly vulnerable to neurodevelopmental disorders (diagnosed at a higher rate with adhd, dyslexia etc)."

The authors hypothesize that the persistence of the external granule layer past 20 postnatal months lead to the development of medulloblastomas (tumors that affect the cerebellum in children). Typically the EGL disappears first in the vermis and then later in the hemispheres.\nEarly postnatal development is also characterized by massive outgrowth of dendrites and axons, followed by synaptogenesis, glial proliferation, and myelination, predominately in the forebrain and cerebellum.\ndevelopmental disruption resulting in cerebellar atrophy could affect cerebello-cortical connectivity.\nthe synapse is an effective point of functional comparison between neocortex and cerebellum. many neurodevelopmental disorders involve deficits in synapse formation, maturation, and function.\n\na typical pyramidal cell in the neocortex has approx 8,000 synapses, whereas a single Purkinje cell may have 200,000 synapses.\nreduced number of synapses are characteristic of many neurodevelopmental disorders\nwe now know that granule cells encode rich sensory information, therefore, synaptic deficits in PCs likely correlate with sensory processing deficits in neurodevelopmental disorders."

    "text": "Cerebellar dysfunction\n\nEvidence from Neuroimaging\n\nstructural and functional abnormalities are commonly reported. specific regions (e.g., vermis) seem to be more prone to ASD-like structural abnormalities.\nwithin the non-motor domain, children and adults with ASD have been reported to show atypical fMRI activation of cortico-cerebellar networks during biological motion perception Jack et al. 2017 and perception fo social interaction Kana et al. 2015.\nLimperopoulos et al. (2014) have shown that perinatal cerebellar injury leads to volume reduction not only in cerebellar grey matter but also in cerebellar white matter and remote neocortical regions. These results suggest that changes in early cerebellar activity affect both cerebellar development and activity of neocortex.\nIt’s also possible that coordinated deficits in the cerebellum and cortex could arise due to a common molecular and/or environmental insult rather than co-dependence between structures.\nthe cerebellum is also implicated in downs syndrome - which is the most prevelent developmental disability with a known genetic origin. People with DS have smaller total cerebellar volumes, smaller frontal and temporal lobes and smaller hippocampal volumes. Similar to ASD, white matter structural changes are also observed in the adult DS brain.\n\nEvidence from Behavior\n\nin people with obvious ‘non-motor’ behavioral abnormalities, do ‘pure’ motor cerebellar abnormalities exist? For example, Tran et al. 2017 tested delayed eyeblink conditioning, a task which is depenedent on the cerebellum, on a group of very preterm children and adults. They found that in this group, there were significant deficits in the acquisition of conditioned responses, therefore suggesting that ‘motor’ cerebellar behavioral abnormalities coexist with non-motor abnormalities.\nchildren with ASD also display abnormal conditioned responses in the eyeblink conditioning paradigm\nit has been suggested that the language and social deficits observed in children with complex disorders are a consequence of deficits in multi-sensory integration.\none particular process that could be implicated in multisensory integration in children with ASD is timing. For example, this process may be impacted by a deficit in perceiving the temporal relationship between distinct sensory components of complex audio-visual stimuli such as language, and this deficit could also compound in social cognitive processes like theory of mind Stevenensen et al. 2014\n\nInter-regional morphogenesis\n\ninterestingly, the cerebellum and the thalamus initiate neuronal differentiation at about the same time - E10.5 Wong et al. 2018\ngiven their common neurogenic timetables, one could speculate that extensive connectivity and matching of developmental trajectories could indicate that early defects in the cerebellum might lead to structural and wiring alterations in the thalamus.\nit has been suggested that the cerebellum could interact its cortical targets using developmental cues that ‘match up’ regions of connectivity: with the goal of establishing a precise topography between subregions of the cerebellar nuclei and subnuclei of the thalamus."

    "text": "Anyone doing precision medicine must never lose sight of the individual who is relying on experts (e.g., scientists, clinicians) to do no harm in providing them with the best possible healthcare outcomes.\n\nMuch of the points below came from a review paper by MacEachern and Forkert (2020)\n\n\nML approaches require large amounts of data, therefore data will be collected from many locations and transferred to a central location for storage and processing. essential that the datasets do not contain patient-identifying information. in the future, this could be overcome using distributed machine learning approaches (e.g., travelling ML model) - trains locally on the available data, before moving to the next center with available data Tuladhar et al. 2020\nML models as “black boxes”, especially with increased complexity of the input data. this raises legal and ethical questions as clinicians and other researchers may not fully understand how an ML model came to a particular conclusion about a patient’s health.\nAs physicians can be held legally responsible for their decisions, error in ML models is of course a concern. Who is responsible for an error induced in an ML model? These tools (for the time being) will support and assist physicians in making decisions about patient care, they are not yet designed to operate autonomously.\nThere are technical limitations to ML models, which is that these models are only as good as the data on which they were trained. However, these training datasets are often inherently noisy and biased. What this means is that models are being created that cannot generalize to more diverse test sets (other regions, diseases, demographics). The easiest way to avoid this problem is to increase the training set and include a diversity of samples, however, this often has logistical (e.g., privacy) challenges.\nFinancial cost is another major concern with pHealth, which will lead to disparities in access to care based on SES. Also, in-depth workups can lead to unintended consequences such as incidental findings that may lead to further testing, which may be invasive and unnecessary, inducing patient stress in the face of diagnostic uncertainty.\nCommunicating uncertainty. there is rarely a clear-cut answer in science, our interpretations operate on probability and likelihood. communicating uncertainty to scientists and non-scientists alike is challenging, especially when decisions are being made that will influence a person’s healthcare outcomes. Therefore, it is important that future machine learning models can identify the most important clinical features for a specific clinical question so that unnecessary assessments can be avoided, maximizing benefit and minimizing harm to patients.\nBias in datasets is one of the most pressing concerns for pHealth. bias can come about due to patient selection, affecting the accuracy and generalizability of the model. Additionally, the financial and practical aspects of implementing pHealth limits the models primarily to the developed world, excluding those in the developing world from the analyses, and any benefits that are offered.\nA yet unanswered question is whether discoveries made by pHealth will have individual impacts on human behavior with respect to disease prevention. For example, if a patient knows that they are at risk for heart disease based on underlying genetic or epigenetic factors, will they change their behavior? Also, it’s possible that such discoveries will create “patients-in-waiting” who are not yet sick but have been identified as high risk."

    "text": "Doing item analysis on sentences within and across measures\nOne question that we have with this dataset is how similar sentences (within and between) measures are semantically similar to each other (i.e. are they arriving at similar constructs). Each measure was designed to measure specific constructs, however, it is not clear the extent to which there is overlap across the many measures that are administered to children in order to arrive at a diagnosis.\nBy applying machine learning tools (e.g., transformer models: https://www.sbert.net/), we can statistically assess the semantic similarity between sentences.\nThen, knowing the similarity between questions, we can compare the similarity between responses to these questions."

This test is thus faster than permutation tests, as it does not require the use of permutations of the data, and it is also deterministic for a given dataset. However, the test should be applied only for high-dimensional data, at least in theory.\nWe will now plot for the case of normal distributions the histogram of the statistic, and compute the Type I error, as seen in Székely and Rizzo1. Users are encouraged to download this example and increase that number to obtain better estimates of the Type I error. In order to replicate the original results, one should set the value of n_tests to 1000."

Thus, increasing the number of permutations makes the p-value more accurate, but increases the computational cost."

    "text": "Embeddings\nThe very first step we have to do is converting the documents to numerical data. We use BERT for this purpose as it extracts different embeddings based on the context of the word. Not only that, there are many pre-trained models available ready to be used.\nHow you generate the BERT embeddings for a document is up to you. However, I prefer to use the sentence-transformers package as the resulting embeddings have shown to be of high quality and typically work quite well for document-level embeddings.\nWe are using Distilbert as it gives a nice balance between speed and performance. The package has several multi-lingual models available for you to use.\nNOTE: Since transformer models have a token limit, you might run into some errors when inputting large documents. In that case, you could consider splitting documents into paragraphs.\n\n# get embeddings\nembeddings = get_embeddings(data, transformer='all-MiniLM-L6-v2') #

Before doing so, we first need to lower the dimensionality of the embeddings as many clustering algorithms handle high dimensionality poorly.\n\nUMAP\nOut of the few dimensionality reduction algorithms, UMAP is arguably the best performing as it keeps a significant portion of the high-dimensional local structure in lower dimensionality.\nWe use the package umap-learn before we lower the dimensionality of the document embeddings. We reduce the dimensionality to 5 while keeping the size of the local neighborhood at 15. You can play around with these values to optimize for your topic creation. Note that a too low dimensionality results in a loss of information while a too high dimensionality results in poorer clustering results.\n\n# get umap embeddings\numap_embeddings = dimensionality_reduction(embeddings)\n\n\n\nHDBSCAN\nAfter having reduced the dimensionality of the documents embeddings to 5, we can cluster the documents with the hdbscan package. HDBSCAN is a density-based algorithm that works quite well with UMAP since UMAP maintains a lot of local structure even in lower-dimensional space. Moreover, HDBSCAN does not force data points to clusters as it considers them outliers.\n\n# get clusters\ncluster = clustering(umap_embeddings, min_cluster_size=30)\n\nGreat! We now have clustered similar documents together which should represent the topics that they consist of. To visualize the resulting clusters we can further reduce the dimensionality to 2 and visualize the outliers as grey points:\n\nplotting_style()\n\n# visualize clusters\nvisualize_clusters(embeddings, cluster, n_neighbors=18)\n\n\n\n\nIt is difficult to visualize the individual clusters due to the number of topics generated. However, we can see that even in 2-dimensional space some local structure is kept.\nNOTE: You could skip the dimensionality reduction step if you use a clustering algorithm that can handle high dimensionality like a cosine-based k-Means."

    "section": "Topic Creation",
    "text": "Topic Creation\nWhat we want to know from the clusters that we generated, is what makes one cluster, based on their content, different from another?\nHow can we derive topics from clustered documents?\nTo solve this, I came up with a class-based variant of TF-IDF (c-TF-IDF), that would allow me to extract what makes each set of documents unique compared to the other.\nThe intuition behind the method is as follows. When you apply TF-IDF as usual on a set of documents, what you are basically doing is comparing the importance of words between documents.\nWhat if, we instead treat all documents in a single category (e.g., a cluster) as a single document and then apply TF-IDF? The result would be a very long document per category and the resulting TF-IDF score would demonstrate the important words in a topic.\n\nc-TF-IDF\nTo create this class-based TF-IDF score, we need to first create a single document for each cluster of documents:\n\n# get docs_per_topic\ndocs_per_topic, docs_df = tf_idf(data, cluster)\n\nThen, we apply the class-based TF-IDF by joining documents within a class. Where the frequency of each word t is extracted for each class i and divided by the total number of words w. This action can be seen as a form of regularization of frequent words in the class. Next, the total, unjoined, number of documents m is divided by the total frequency of word t across all classes n.\n\n# get idf scores\ntf_idf, count = c_tf_idf(docs_per_topic.Doc.values, m=len(data))\n\nNow, we have a single importance value for each word in a cluster which can be used to create the topic. If we take the top 10 most important words in each cluster, then we would get a good representation of a cluster, and thereby a topic.\nIn order to create a topic representation, we take the top 20 words per topic based on their c-TF-IDF scores. The higher the score, the more representative it should be of its topic as the score is a proxy of information density.\n\n# create topic representation\ntop_n_words = extract_top_n_words_per_topic(tf_idf, count, docs_per_topic, n=20)\ntopic_sizes = extract_topic_sizes(docs_df); \n\nWe can use topic_sizes to view how frequent certain topics are:\n\nprint(topic_sizes.head(10))\n\n    Topic  Size\n0      -1  1520\n27     26  1253\n31     30   468\n8       7   370\n7       6   337\n2       1   291\n20     19   205\n24     23   124\n23     22   115\n13     12   113\n\n\nThe topic name-1 refers to all documents that did not have any topics assigned. The great thing about HDBSCAN is that not all documents are forced towards a certain cluster. If no cluster could be found, then it is simply an outlier.\nWe can see that topics 28,6,43 are the largest clusters that we could create. To view the words belonging to those topics, we can simply use the dictionarytop_n_words to access these topics:\n\n# print(top_n_words[31][:10])\n\n# print(top_n_words[27][:10])\n\n# print(top_n_words[7][:10])\n\n# print(top_n_words[3][:10])\n\nLooking at the largest four topics, I would say that these nicely seem to represent easily interpretable topics!"

You can tweak the parameters of HDBSCAN such that you will get fewer topics through its min_cluster_size parameter but it does not allow you to specify the exact number of clusters.\nA nifty trick that Top2Vec was using is the ability to reduce the number of topics by merging the topic vectors that were most similar to each other.\nWe can use a similar technique by comparing the c-TF-IDF vectors among topics, merge the most similar ones, and finally re-calculate the c-TF-IDF vectors to update the representation of our topics:\n\n# topic reduction\n\ndocs_df_adj, top_n_words_adj = topic_reduction(data, docs_df, tf_idf)\ntopic_sizes_adj = extract_topic_sizes(docs_df_adj);\n\nAbove, we took the least common topic and merged it with the most similar topic. By repeating this 19 more times we reduced the number of topics from 56 to 36!\nNOTE: We can skip the re-calculation part of this pipeline to speed up the topic reduction step. However, it is more accurate to re-calculate the c-TF-IDF vectors as that would better represent the newly generated content of the topics. You can play around with this by, for example, update every n steps to both speed-up the process and still have good topic representations.\nTIP: You can use the method described in this article (or simply use BERTopic) to also create sentence-level embeddings. The main advantage of this is the possibility to view the distribution of topics within a single document.\n\n# print(top_n_words_adj[31][:10])\n\n# print(top_n_words_adj[2][:10])\n\n# print(top_n_words_adj[29][:10])\n\n# print(top_n_words_adj[31][:10])"

complex.\nComplex is better than complicated.\nFlat is better than nested.\nSparse is better than dense.\nReadability counts.\nSpecial cases aren't special enough to break the rules.\nAlthough practicality beats purity.\nErrors should never pass silently.\nUnless explicitly silenced.\nIn the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.\nThere should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.\nAlthough that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.\nNow is better than never.\nAlthough never is often better than *right* now.\nIf the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.\nIf the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.\nNamespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!\nreading

Robbins, to edit an issue of Elsevier’s Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences on the theme of “Role of the Cerebellum in Cognition and Behavior”. A brief introduction to our vision for this issue is included at the end of this message for context.\nWe are inviting several our colleagues around the world to contribute to this issue and given your expertise and reputation we very much hope that you will be willing to contribute a short review. We’d like to suggest that your review covers “Cerebellum as part of a network,” but the exact scope and title will be shaped by you. We just ask for any proposed change to the general scope of your review to be discussed with us to ensure consistency and balance in the overall content of the issue. Your contribution would consist of a short narrative review of approximately 2000 words, and it would ideally focus on interesting and relevant articles (no more than 50) published recently in the field. We would like you to annotate a few of the most important references in the bibliography of your review, as this is a key feature of the journal. You are welcome to invite additional co-authors if you wish, but we ask that you remain the senior author.\nManuscripts will be due by May 31, 2023 and all accepted articles will be available online and fully citable between acceptance and final compilation of the issue. If this deadline is prohibitive to your acceptance, please let us know and we will do our best to accommodate extension requests. This is an informal invitation from us as editors; upon acceptance, you will receive a follow up email from Aqsa Jabeen (Editorial Manager at Elsevier, in copy) containing additional information to help with your submission.\nWietske and I hope you are willing to contribute to what we think will be an outstanding volume that focuses on our current understanding of the theme. Kindly let us know.\nBest regards, Sheeba Anteraper\nIntroduction: Role of the Cerebellum in Cognition and Behavior In recent years, many developmental and neuropsychiatric disorders have been linked to dysfunction in cerebellar circuits. At the same time, the field of cerebellar functional neuroanatomy has made rapid progress, describing multiple interdigitated representations of both motor and non-motor functions. These findings now open the door to much more detailed investigation of cerebellar abnormalities. This special issue aims to bring together the most recent insights into the functional organization of the cerebellum with cutting-edge work on dysfunction of these circuits in neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases."

Developmental neuroscience, 43(3-4), 181-190.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe human cerebellum develops over a long time, extending from early embryonic period until the first postnatal yearsMost of its volume increases during the last trimester of pregnancy, which is considered a critical period for cerebellar development\nLast few months of gestation are the time during which the cerebellar nuclei start to form their major afferents and efferents from/to cerebral cortices and subcortical structures and this development continues during the first years after birth\nDevelopmental diaschisis idea: cerebellar connections with contralateral cerebral cortices (specifically DLPFC) are well established - an interruption of this circuit between areas of the CNS may determine a diaschisis - a functional impairment of the region linked to the one subject of a structural lesion\nCerebellar injury in preterms:\nCerebellar underdevelopment (cerebellar atrophy/hypoplasia)\nDestructive cerebellar lesions (primary and focal injury, hemorrhage or infarction)\nWhat causes cerebellar underdevelopment in preterm babies?\n\nBlood products (hemosiderin)\nPerinatal glucocorticoid exposure\nOpioids and pain\nInadequate nutrition\nInfections\nInflammations\nHypoxic-ischemic insults\nCerebral brain injuries\n\nsocioeconomic status\nWhat causes destructive cerebellar lesions?\n\nCerebellar hemorrhage\nCerebellar infarction\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlacenta is also an endocrine organ that makes a variety of steroids and peptide hormones that are essential for uterine health. We haven’t considered how those compounds contribute directly to fetal development, particularly the fetal brian.\nProgesterone - dominates eraly in preganncy creating a healthy uterine environment, and late in pregnancy, estrogen levels rise, upregulating oxytocin receptors in preparation for the induction of contractions when the time is right.\nPremature fetuses are being deprived of allopregnaolone at a time when the brain is rapidly developing. Penn et al. study: created a mouse model in which allopregnanolone production by the placenta was selectively prevented to determine if there were consequences from the loss. Transcriptomic analysis of multiple brain regions at postnatal day 30 revealed the cerebellum to be the region most affected. Gene expression associated with white matter was broadly altered in the cerebellum.\nBirth is a particularly important point in cerebellar development, because of the sudden physical demands of living outside the womb.\nPremature loss of allopregnanolone affected males and females differently\nIn males: when assessed for their sociability, allopregnanolone-deprived males showed less preference for interacting with another mouse overa n object, they were also deficient at emitting a distress call when isolated from their mothers.\nMales: greater myelination and increased connectivity (neuronal activity is a goldilocks phenomenon: needs to be just right)\nA single injection of allopregnanolone in pregnant mice was sufficient to reduce both the cerebellar myelination and behavioral abnormalities in male offspring lacking placental allopregnanolone and restore them to values observed in their unaffected littermates and females.\nResults also confirmed via cerebella of infants who were born prematurely or after a normal-length pregnancy and found compelling evidence of accelerated myelination in boys born prematurely but not in girls\nWhy do males and females respond so differently to the loss of allopregnanolone?\n\n\n\n\n\nEffects of environmental agents on cerebellar development are profound\nPrenatal alcohol exposure and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is the most common teratogenic disorder affecting humans\nMany of the phenotypic effects of FASD are the result of cerebellar injury and dysfunction\nCerebellum and sleep and maternal stress during pregnancy (van den Heuvel eta l. 2021)\nMaternal psych stress/negative affect during pregnancy was associated with variation in fetal cortico-cerebellar connectivity.\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman neonatal cerebellum is one-fourth of its adult size yet contains the blueprint required to integrate the environmental cues with developing motor, cognitive and emotional skills into adulthood.\nUnique feature of the human cerebellum is that the progenitor zones have extended proliferative activity, suggesting human-specific expansion of these zones\nThis work establishes a developmental cell atlas of the human cerebellum as a solid fondation, enabling novel discoverities related to cerebellar development and origin of disease\nHuman cerebellar development is protracted - extending from 30d after conception through the second postnatal year of life - and is influenced by environmental and sensory cues that shape brain circuitry\n\n\n\n\n\nNeurodevelopmental PGS-associated genes were preferentially expressed in the cerebellum, where their expression peaked prenatally\nLower gray matter volumes in cerebellum and functionally coupled cortical regions were associated with psychiatric symptoms in mid-childhood\n\n\n\n\n\nPreterm birth and cerebellar hemorrhage coincide with, and may specifically disrupt, the period of highly dynamic cerebellar development that is characterized by morphologic and synaptic reorganization. There may be a developmental time window during which the cerebellum is central for the acquisition of cognitive function and social skills\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cerebellum is suited to support the fast, effective, dynamic sequences required to perform tasks relatively automatically. By delegating stereotyped within-task computations to the cerebellum, the cerebral cortex can be freed up to focus on the more challenging aspects of performing the tasks in parallel.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the first trimester: deep cerebellar nuclei form (Amore et al. 2021)\nDuring second trimester: the granular layers and the vermis form (Bromley et al. 1994)\nDuring the third trimester: cerebellum volume begins to increase exponentially and axonal connections are formed with the rest of the CNS (Pierson and Al Sufiani, 2016)\nRapid cerebellar growth presents a five-fold increase in volume - 3rd trimester is therefore a critical period in cerebellum development (Limperopoulos et al. 2005A; 2005B; Volpe, 2009b)\nOnce the cerebellum is fully formed, it has approximately five times more neurons than the cerebrum (Herculano-Houzel, 2009).\nCerebellar injury and volume loss is observed in about 20% of infants born before 32 weeks, with incidence increasing in those born before 28 weeks (steggerda et al. 2009)\nCerebellar underdevelopment at this point in life is associated with a spectrum of severity, with the most severely affected children exhibiting cerebral palsy, epilepsy, intellectual disabilities, and ASD.\nPremature children with damage to the vermis accounted for majority of those with social challenges (Limperopoulos et al. 2007)\n70% of all brain tumors in children are posterior fossa tumors. After resection, approximately 25% develop posterior fossa syndrome which is defined as temporary mutism lasting no more than 6 months as well as extreme emotional lability and changes in social behavior (see Riva and Giorgi 2000 paper for case studies of 6 children who underwent surgical ablation of the right vermis to treat posterior fossa tumors).\nWas previously believed that posterior fossa syndrome was caused by damage to the vermis - this view has now been supplanted by the idea that the pathophysiology is due to the cerebello-thalamo-cortical white matter tract.\nWhile this view would predict that damage anywhere along the pathway would result in core symptoms of posterior fossa syndrome, in practice, the constellation of deficits observed in posterior fossa syndrome are most common after damage to regions encompassing the start point of the CTC tract: dentate nucleus of the cerebellum or cerebellar peduncles.\nSchreiber et al., (2017) tested the 5-year cognitive outcomes of children who had posterior fossa syndrome compared to children with similar tumor resections that did not result in the same disorder. They found that the posterior fossa group exhibited IQ, working memory, speed of processing, and general attention functions that were more than 1 standard deviation below the mean and that there was almost no recovery of function over the 5-years post-surgery.\nWhy are changes in social behavior mild during adulthood?\n\nCCAS in adults: deficits in four key areas of cognition - spatial processing, executive functioning, linguistic abilities, personality changes - social consequences of CCAS arise after damage to the posterior lobe, especially when the vermis is damaged (Schmahmann and Sherman, 1998).\nDisorder remains controversial because because it is only rarely observed in the clinic. Consequences of cerebellar damage on observable social behavior in adults are described as rare (Branch & Coslett, 2022), transient (Schmahmann & Sherman, 1998) or mild (Wang et al. 2014) - especially when contrasted to the changes in social compartment observed after lesions to orbitofrontal cortex (Schneider and Koenigs, 2017).\nThe point: adult-onset cerebellar damage does not cause adult-onset ASD\nBut somewhat consistent are deficits on sequencing tasks (van overwalle work) but mild to no deficits on ToM tasks (Beuriat, Cohen-Zimermann et al. 2022).\nExplanations for developmental differences between children and adult deficits:\nLesions in children could be larger and more likely to impinge on Crus I/II, thereby affecting social behavior to a larger degree\nLesions in children could affect deep nuclei and white matter tracts linking the cerebellum to the cerebrum to a larger degree.\nPossible that the tasks used to assess social cognition in adults do not have sufficient variance and/or do not capture the nature of cerebellar social deficits.\nCauses of cerebellar damage in early life are different than in adulthood.\n\nExplaining the age gradient:\n\nForward internal model explanation - cerebellum receives a command signal from the cerebrum, compares that command to sensory feedback, and then creates a prediction error signal that fine tunes the command based on what the desired outcome is and sends it back to the cerebrum (Ito 2008). This is in contrast to the inverse internal model in which the cerebellum receives a desired outcome from the cerebrum and produces the action that reaches that outcome.\nBoth are supervised learning models which rely on large amounts of data where the action to outcome pairings are known, the inverse model is optimal when extensive training has occurred.\nProposal is that the cerebellum builds and deploys mental models that shift from one dominant model type to another model-type over the course of development.\nAs a child, the cerebellum’s forward internal model model mechanism helps create social mental models of the world that offer predictions of outcomes that are constantly being tested and retested to refine the model. Prediction errors allow the model to be adaptive when encountering new or uncertain social situations (Sokolov et al. 2017). These models would be stored in portions of the cerebral cortex referred to as the “social brain”. Frosch et al. (2022): if for some reason the cerebellum was not able to build social mental models or was not able to access them (because of damage to structural connections), then individuals would find it hard to predict how others might act or how their words or actions might be received (a la developmental diaschisis idea from wang et al. 2014: the idea being that the cerebellum drives the maturation of functional circuits in the evolutionarily newer and more functionally plastic association cortex of the cerebrum to which it is connected - cerebellar damage early in life causes downstream dysfunction in the cerebrum because the cerebellum cannot create forward models that functionally tune the frontal lobe.\n\nWhat is happening between childhood and adulthood?\n\nBy adulthood, the cerebellum has already built up a repetoire of highly predictive social mental models in social thoughts or behavior. Therefore, the forward model ceases to be important for social behavior, and there is a shift in the dominant model executed by cerebellar computations.\nThe dominant model now becomes the inverse internal model of the cerebellum, which executes automated thoughts and behaviors. Therefore, social deficits following cerebellar damage in adulthood would likely take the form of slowness or difficulty iniating an otherwise automated response.\nInterpreting existing fMRI studies in adults through the lens of this model can be difficult. If the task requires new social rules or behaviors with error-driven feedback, the activations likely reflect the deployment of the forward model. Maybe it’s also possible that the cerebellum receives the input and concludes via low prediction errors, that no adjustments need to be made to what the cerebellum is computing.\n\nCerebellar learning study: Crus I/II will be activated when learning the new body language and activations will decrease more quickly in individuals who learn more quickly.

We haven’t considered how those compounds contribute directly to fetal development, particularly the fetal brian.\nProgesterone - dominates eraly in preganncy creating a healthy uterine environment, and late in pregnancy, estrogen levels rise, upregulating oxytocin receptors in preparation for the induction of contractions when the time is right.\nPremature fetuses are being deprived of allopregnaolone at a time when the brain is rapidly developing. Penn et al. study: created a mouse model in which allopregnanolone production by the placenta was selectively prevented to determine if there were consequences from the loss. Transcriptomic analysis of multiple brain regions at postnatal day 30 revealed the cerebellum to be the region most affected. Gene expression associated with white matter was broadly altered in the cerebellum.\nBirth is a particularly important point in cerebellar development, because of the sudden physical demands of living outside the womb.\nPremature loss of allopregnanolone affected males and females differently\nIn males: when assessed for their sociability, allopregnanolone-deprived males showed less preference for interacting with another mouse overa n object, they were also deficient at emitting a distress call when isolated from their mothers.\nMales: greater myelination and increased connectivity (neuronal activity is a goldilocks phenomenon: needs to be just right)\nA single injection of allopregnanolone in pregnant mice was sufficient to reduce both the cerebellar myelination and behavioral abnormalities in male offspring lacking placental allopregnanolone and restore them to values observed in their unaffected littermates and females.\nResults also confirmed via cerebella of infants who were born prematurely or after a normal-length pregnancy and found compelling evidence of accelerated myelination in boys born prematurely but not in girls\nWhy do males and females respond so differently to the loss of allopregnanolone?\n\n\n\n\n\nEffects of environmental agents on cerebellar development are profound\nPrenatal alcohol exposure and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is the most common teratogenic disorder affecting humans\nMany of the phenotypic effects of FASD are the result of cerebellar injury and dysfunction\nCerebellum and sleep and maternal stress during pregnancy (van den Heuvel eta l. 2021)\nMaternal psych stress/negative affect during pregnancy was associated with variation in fetal cortico-cerebellar connectivity.\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman neonatal cerebellum is one-fourth of its adult size yet contains the blueprint required to integrate the environmental cues with developing motor, cognitive and emotional skills into adulthood.\nUnique feature of the human cerebellum is that the progenitor zones have extended proliferative activity, suggesting human-specific expansion of these zones\nThis work establishes a developmental cell atlas of the human cerebellum as a solid fondation, enabling novel discoverities related to cerebellar development and origin of disease\nHuman cerebellar development is protracted - extending from 30d after conception through the second postnatal year of life - and is influenced by environmental and sensory cues that shape brain circuitry\n\n\n\n\n\nNeurodevelopmental PGS-associated genes were preferentially expressed in the cerebellum, where their expression peaked prenatally\nLower gray matter volumes in cerebellum and functionally coupled cortical regions were associated with psychiatric symptoms in mid-childhood\n\n\n\n\n\nPreterm birth and cerebellar hemorrhage coincide with, and may specifically disrupt, the period of highly dynamic cerebellar development that is characterized by morphologic and synaptic reorganization. There may be a developmental time window during which the cerebellum is central for the acquisition of cognitive function and social skills\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cerebellum is suited to support the fast, effective, dynamic sequences required to perform tasks relatively automatically. By delegating stereotyped within-task computations to the cerebellum, the cerebral cortex can be freed up to focus on the more challenging aspects of performing the tasks in parallel.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the first trimester: deep cerebellar nuclei form (Amore et al. 2021)\nDuring second trimester: the granular layers and the vermis form (Bromley et al. 1994)\nDuring the third trimester: cerebellum volume begins to increase exponentially and axonal connections are formed with the rest of the CNS (Pierson and Al Sufiani, 2016)\nRapid cerebellar growth presents a five-fold increase in volume - 3rd trimester is therefore a critical period in cerebellum development (Limperopoulos et al. 2005A; 2005B; Volpe, 2009b)\nOnce the cerebellum is fully formed, it has approximately five times more neurons than the cerebrum (Herculano-Houzel, 2009).\nCerebellar injury and volume loss is observed in about 20% of infants born before 32 weeks, with incidence increasing in those born before 28 weeks (steggerda et al. 2009)\nCerebellar underdevelopment at this point in life is associated with a spectrum of severity, with the most severely affected children exhibiting cerebral palsy, epilepsy, intellectual disabilities, and ASD.\nPremature children with damage to the vermis accounted for majority of those with social challenges (Limperopoulos et al. 2007)\n70% of all brain tumors in children are posterior fossa tumors. After resection, approximately 25% develop posterior fossa syndrome which is defined as temporary mutism lasting no more than 6 months as well as extreme emotional lability and changes in social behavior (see Riva and Giorgi 2000 paper for case studies of 6 children who underwent surgical ablation of the right vermis to treat posterior fossa tumors).\nWas previously believed that posterior fossa syndrome was caused by damage to the vermis - this view has now been supplanted by the idea that the pathophysiology is due to the cerebello-thalamo-cortical white matter tract.\nWhile this view would predict that damage anywhere along the pathway would result in core symptoms of posterior fossa syndrome, in practice, the constellation of deficits observed in posterior fossa syndrome are most common after damage to regions encompassing the start point of the CTC tract: dentate nucleus of the cerebellum or cerebellar peduncles.\nSchreiber et al., (2017) tested the 5-year cognitive outcomes of children who had posterior fossa syndrome compared to children with similar tumor resections that did not result in the same disorder. They found that the posterior fossa group exhibited IQ, working memory, speed of processing, and general attention functions that were more than 1 standard deviation below the mean and that there was almost no recovery of function over the 5-years post-surgery.\nWhy are changes in social behavior mild during adulthood?\n\nCCAS in adults: deficits in four key areas of cognition - spatial processing, executive functioning, linguistic abilities, personality changes - social consequences of CCAS arise after damage to the posterior lobe, especially when the vermis is damaged (Schmahmann and Sherman, 1998).\nDisorder remains controversial because because it is only rarely observed in the clinic. Consequences of cerebellar damage on observable social behavior in adults are described as rare (Branch & Coslett, 2022), transient (Schmahmann & Sherman, 1998) or mild (Wang et al. 2014) - especially when contrasted to the changes in social compartment observed after lesions to orbitofrontal cortex (Schneider and Koenigs, 2017).\nThe point: adult-onset cerebellar damage does not cause adult-onset ASD\nBut somewhat consistent are deficits on sequencing tasks (van overwalle work) but mild to no deficits on ToM tasks (Beuriat, Cohen-Zimermann et al. 2022).\nExplanations for developmental differences between children and adult deficits:\nLesions in children could be larger and more likely to impinge on Crus I/II, thereby affecting social behavior to a larger degree\nLesions in children could affect deep nuclei and white matter tracts linking the cerebellum to the cerebrum to a larger degree.\nPossible that the tasks used to assess social cognition in adults do not have sufficient variance and/or do not capture the nature of cerebellar social deficits.\nCauses of cerebellar damage in early life are different than in adulthood.\n\nExplaining the age gradient:\n\nForward internal model explanation - cerebellum receives a command signal from the cerebrum, compares that command to sensory feedback, and then creates a prediction error signal that fine tunes the command based on what the desired outcome is and sends it back to the cerebrum (Ito 2008). This is in contrast to the inverse internal model in which the cerebellum receives a desired outcome from the cerebrum and produces the action that reaches that outcome.\nBoth are supervised learning models which rely on large amounts of data where the action to outcome pairings are known, the inverse model is optimal when extensive training has occurred.\nProposal is that the cerebellum builds and deploys mental models that shift from one dominant model type to another model-type over the course of development.\nAs a child, the cerebellum’s forward internal model model mechanism helps create social mental models of the world that offer predictions of outcomes that are constantly being tested and retested to refine the model. Prediction errors allow the model to be adaptive when encountering new or uncertain social situations (Sokolov et al. 2017). These models would be stored in portions of the cerebral cortex referred to as the “social brain”. Frosch et al. (2022): if for some reason the cerebellum was not able to build social mental models or was not able to access them (because of damage to structural connections), then individuals would find it hard to predict how others might act or how their words or actions might be received (a la developmental diaschisis idea from wang et al. 2014: the idea being that the cerebellum drives the maturation of functional circuits in the evolutionarily newer and more functionally plastic association cortex of the cerebrum to which it is connected - cerebellar damage early in life causes downstream dysfunction in the cerebrum because the cerebellum cannot create forward models that functionally tune the frontal lobe.\n\nWhat is happening between childhood and adulthood?\n\nBy adulthood, the cerebellum has already built up a repetoire of highly predictive social mental models in social thoughts or behavior. Therefore, the forward model ceases to be important for social behavior, and there is a shift in the dominant model executed by cerebellar computations.\nThe dominant model now becomes the inverse internal model of the cerebellum, which executes automated thoughts and behaviors. Therefore, social deficits following cerebellar damage in adulthood would likely take the form of slowness or difficulty iniating an otherwise automated response.\nInterpreting existing fMRI studies in adults through the lens of this model can be difficult. If the task requires new social rules or behaviors with error-driven feedback, the activations likely reflect the deployment of the forward model. Maybe it’s also possible that the cerebellum receives the input and concludes via low prediction errors, that no adjustments need to be made to what the cerebellum is computing.\n\nCerebellar learning study: Crus I/II will be activated when learning the new body language and activations will decrease more quickly in individuals who learn more quickly. Social-activated regions of Crus I/II will be functionally synchronized ith socially sensitive regions of the cerebrum.\nAdults with cerebellar damage should be able to learn alien social norms but they’ll do so extremely slowly and using explict, language-based learning mechanisms."
