# Feature Selection
## Supervised options: 
1. Filtering based on some criterion (correlation between variables) - feature importance
2. Search problem: wrapped-based solution that selects features using something like recursive feature elimination
3. Embedding/Intrinsic: algorithms like Lasso and random forest have built-in feature selection methods

## Unsupervised
1. These methods don't have target variable - instead remove redundant variables

## Dimensionality Reduction
1. Project input data into a lower-dimensional feature space
