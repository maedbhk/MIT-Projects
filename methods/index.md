Instead of writing notes about methods in my lab notebook, I'm writing them here (when I remember)

- [`Feature Engineering`](feature-engineering.md)
- [`fMRI Parcellations`](fmri_parcellations.md)
- [`Model Evaluation`](model-evaluation.md)
- [`Model Interpretability`](model-interpretability.md)
- [`Modeling Electronic Health Records`](modeling-EHR.md)
- [`Imbalanced Data`](smote.md)
- [`Unsupervised Learning`](unsupervised-learning.md)
