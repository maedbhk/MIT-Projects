title: Keynote - Mac Shine - Neurobiological basis of cognition
---

* Neuroscience is segregated (computational, clinical, systems, cognitive)
* fMRI can integrate across dynamical systems, clinical disorders etc. 
* neurobiology and non-linear dynamical systems need to talk to each other in order to make progress
* attractor landscape: set of all possible brain states
* neurobiology is complex - how can i cluster the data? 
* heuristic models of the brain
	* prelimbic, motor, auditory, visual
* embed the brain as a network
* you can get a long way without the cerebral cortex: sensory, cognitive, motor (plug for cerebellum!)
* we need to understand the contribution of the subcortex to cognition? 
* multiple thalamic regions
* a diversity of thalamocortical interactions: specific, multi-specific, non-specific, thalamo-striatal
* many ways to carve up the thalamus
* laminar flow analysis
	* time series from resting state data, turbulent or non-turbulent
	* periods of time when the brain is stable, and periods of time when it is not
* any time you have many variables, you need computional models
* corticothalamic neural mass model
* great graphic of upside down brain (conceptual organization of brain) -- how can we think about evolutionary old structures and the constraints they place on brain organization?
