DAY 1: 11/18/23

### opening remarks
* women are underrepresented as professors
* 36% of all professors in US are women
* at MIT - 24% 2020 - science - women faculty

### work-life balance in academia: 
* panelists: debbie chachra; megan nunez; farmaz niroui
* flexibility
* at work, every minute counts
* harder to draw boundaries these days
* birth control + the 401k - what women have today.
* you can't spend your whole life waiting for life.
* every to-do list is a negotation with mortality
* how you spend your days is how you spend your life
* JUST ASK
* you've probably learned a lot already about how you like to manage your time 
* learn to balance two objects before someone throws you a chainsaw

### what type of institution is right for you
* making a case for canada..
* small liberal arts schools: mentorship programs + close relationship with professors
* teach at a community college during postdoc?
* "how to each whtat you don't know" - book

### what type of institution is right for you
* indeed.com
* capd at MIT - workshops for going thru research statements
* you're looking to craft your own story
* your story is something you're going to build over a lifetime
* it's going to be hard to talk at length about something that doesn't interest you
* spending time in a postdoc is a unique opportunity to define your own research trajectory (separate from your mentor)
    * it's in your best interest to differentiate yourself early on, because of your mentor's PI
* hiring committee wants to be awakened:
    * what strikes the fire in your belly
    * good, clear crisp writing (person reading it will be happier)
    * is this an enthusiastic applicant? 
* who would you collaborate with in this department? 
* faculty are looking for colleagues

### applying
* always commmunicate with the chair of the search. ask who you are meeting
* interviews work both ways. you are interviewing the institution and the people who are part of it as much as they are interviewing you. 
* do your homework about the institution. take notes about every person you're going to meet, and prepare 1-2 questions to ask each person you are meeting with.
* be genuine and sincere. 
* you're lucky if your search committee has read most of your materials. do not assume that everyone knows everything already. 
* how does the department align with your long and short term goals. prepare interviews by identifying what skills/experience you can bring to the department. 
* what kind of interview is this?
* screening interview: 30 min chat. 
* you can reach out to search chair and ask questions about the format. sometimes you get the interview questions in advance. often you do not. 
* show interest through your questions. 
* committee wants collegiality.

* 45 min presentation and 45 min Q&A from audience
* have slides with clear research question(s), lit review, methods, findings, contribution of work
    * cite research of faculty in dept of interviews if they have published research on that topic. 
    * quite possible that the audience doesn't know your research - they might not have shared knowledge (first few slides, what's your research about)
* include slide on research trajectory, how current talk connects with future research, and dept of interview
* anticipate the questions and prepare answers for questions you may receive from the audience. 
* don't be shy in asking for help!!!
* nobody wants to see your life, they just want to see you as a scientist -- really? 
* practice: elevator pitch. elevator pitch. elevator pitch.
* in person interview logistics and tips: 
    * interview begins the moment you arrive. 
    * be prepared to talk all day about you and your work. 
    * show enthuasiasm for your work. if you are not excited, no one else will be. 
    * be a good listener and ask questions. be enthusiastic about your potential colleagues' work.
* lunch meeting with grad students: don't let your guard down.
* cautious on personal matters. 
* yes, dress the part. 
* send thank you emails. who to? 
* teaching demonstration (if applicable) - you need to find this out from the search committee. 
* interview tips:
* DO:
    * ask questions about mentorship to advance to tenure, infrasturture for research support
    * have ideas on what classes you may teach in the dept (look at course website)
        * don't offer a class they've never taught before
    * think about thow your work intersects/aligns with others in the dept
    * be genuinely interested in the students you interact with.
* DON'T:
    * be over enthsiastic or too effusive in your praise
    * be too shy or silent at semi-social events (e.g., meals)
    * pretend to remember every detail you hear, take notes
    * compare the institution to your current or comparable instituion explicitly 
    * provide your "expert" opinion on methodology or science that contradicts your to-be colleagues
        * in response to "i already this" - respond diplomatically
        * i disagree with your x paper - respond diplomatically
* when you're interacting with faculty:
    * be interested in their research
    * good if you can ask an insightful question or two, point out area of overlap, potential collaboration
    * meetings with faculty, mgiht be focused on teaching or research
    * meals are less formal, but remember you are still being interviewed.
* faculty will ask:
    * what kind of students do you want (their backgrounds)
    * will you do all this work yourself (in your lab) or will you collaborate with others, what will their contributions be? 
    * what is the biggest problem/question in your field?
    * how will you demonstrate independence from your advisor?

    * how big do you want your lab to be (students and square footage)
    * how much start-up funding do you need? do your homework; what are typical recent start-up requests for this type of instituion. make sure you can get what you need to be successful, but a completely out-of-line request could take you out of the competition. be sure you can justify everything you request. 
    * what salary do you want? do not give a specific number, say something like "i'm sure a potential offer would be a competitive salary"
* interactions with adminostrators/HR
* after the interview, send emails to everyone:
    * colleagues you met as well.
    * definitely the chair of the search committee
* can use "after the interview" as a delay tactic

### negotiating
* starts before you get the offer
* put together a spreadsheet and send it back and get feedback
* chair of the dept wants you to get everything you want, but they have to negotiate on your behalf. 
* will i be able to get tenure with this package? 
* will i be able to live on this salary? 
* do i actually want to work at this place?
* ask for summer pay 
* you don't need a partner in academia to negotiate
    * the university can help your partner elsewhere
* one-on-one advise for negotiating on handshake (capd)

### building a professional network and reputation
* [networking cheatsheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vnHt_j7ssDAnfJreL_0SWiWUpdYTJIMj/view?usp=sharing)
* walk through open doors and take advantage of new opportunities
* it's really important to have a single tag line that people can remember and take back with them
* ellen roche: make networking a part of your day-to-day rather than a chore
* flip a coin and whatever your gut reaction tells you is what you really feel

DAY 2: 11/19/2023

### research statements
* simona rosu, phd - srosu@mit.edu - senior assistant director - postdoctoral career and professional development
    * good contact for reviewing research statement
* goals:
    * convince the search committee that you have intersting, exciting, impactful research ideas
    * you have the track record and experience to carry it out
    * you have well thought-out plan/specific project ideas to get started (what would you do in the first few years)
* know your audience:
    * tenured and TT faculty - in and outside of hiring dept. 
    * members are often over-committeed and busy
    * may/may not be familiar or interested in your field
    * trying to get a quick picture of you and your research
* make it easy for them!
    * everything should be easy to read, clear and polished (content and format)
* content:
    * background and significance (introducting the big ideas/questions/challenges) - why is this an important topic
    * brief overview of past and current research
        * key accomplishments: approaches, results, and signifiance
        * highlight related publications, fellowships/awards
        * consider relevance to future research proposal
    * future research (3-5 years and vision) - longest chunk of statement?
        * long-term vision, major strategies and approaches, expected impact
        * specific projects/plan for the next 3-5 years
        * mention potential funding sources
        * mention interest in potential collaborations (in and outside institution)
* two common ways to organize statement:
    * chronological: 
        * intro and vision
        * past research (accomplishment 1 and 2)
        * future research (project 1 and 2)
        * conclusions/outlook
    * thematic:
        * intro and vision
        * theme 1 (past and future research)
        * theme 2 (past and future research)
        * themes shouldn't depend on each other (ideally) - you could still do theme 2 if 1 fails
* what you are trying to convey:
    * importance of your research
    * focus (well thought out plan)
    * independence (how does it differ from current and past mentors)
    * creativity
    * realism (acknowledgement of possible limitations and alternatives)
    * clarity
    * fundability
    * appropriate scope for type of institution (fit)
        * explicitly comment on why research is well-suited for undergraduates
* formatting and tips:
    * length varies by field and position (3-5 pages)
    * make it easy to "skim" - use descriptive title, use section headings, use visuals (key figures/diagrams), avoid long, convoluted sentences, be clear and direct
* writing tips:
    * use active voice (e.g., I developed..; My research group will..)
    * avoid ambiguous "we": clarify your contributions and acknowledge collaborations (e.g., I developed method X. My collaborators applied method X to show..)
    * make it clear when you are talking about your proposal vs. general background
        * problem X is important..I could use approach A to address this problem
    * writing to communicate to a broader audience
        * explain any key terms and concepts
        * avoid jargon when possible; avoid overuse of abbreviations
    * walk your audience through it - be explicit (don't assume it's obvious)
        * comment on the significance, rationale, impact of your approaches
        * why are you choosing these questions/problems?
        * why are you choosing these approaches? 
        * what is unique/novel about your proposal? how does it differ from others in the field? 
        * what is the expected impact? 
    * general advice:
        * start early
        * reflect on your vision
        * get feedback from faculty, peers, and other professionals (inside and outside your field)
        * practice communicating your science (inside your field; outside your field; research slam)
    * question / answer / approach
    * touch on grad and postdoc work
        * you can choose to spend more time on certain parts of your work (grad vs. postdoc work)
        * what pieces of your work has been published - if your postdoc work is early on, you still want to talk about accomplishments (papers etc.)
    * ask peers for feedback / ask people within/outside your network for feedback
    * writing and communications center can give you feedback
    * majority of future research section in research statement - what you plan to do, but you can also talk about potential collaborations that you'll have with faculty in the dept. 

### funding
* k99 grant - path to independence
