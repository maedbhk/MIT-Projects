title: Keynote - Emily Finn - Imaging Subjective Experience
---

* How do individuals arrive at different interpretations from the same information? 
* how do we measure this? 
	* bistable stimuli (necker cube)

## why care about subjective experience?
* differences in subjective experience contribute to polarization
* depression and other mood disorders are associated with a negative interpretation bias
* only the subjective experience of childhood maltreatment predicts later psychopathology

## why care about the brain for subjective experience?
* what can the brain add to the study of subjective experience?
* introspection is hard, people tell you what they think but not why
	* maybe we can use brain activity as a real-out to understand which features they're reacting to to influence their experience
	* the brain is casual: change the brain, change the experience (non-invasive work and neuro-feedback work)
	* the brain knows best: better than behavior and self-report measures sometimes

## why study brains as they are subjectively experiencing something?
* you're better off scanning people while they're experiencing soemthing (ideally something that you have some control over)
* functional brain organization can be mapped regardless of state
* task connectivity during task is more unique, stable, reliable, heritable, meaningful
* PNC: WM and emotional task > rest (this is true across lots of datasets)
* tasks that give best signal are those that give us more experimentar control over / knowledge of what the subject is doing
* thought sampling improves fingerprinting and behavior prediction
* thought sampling are simliar to rest, but different in that you're getting read-outs of what people are "thinking"
* naturalistic movie-watching > rest
* tasks act as a lens through which individuals can be projected
	* move towards task-design rather than rest

## new approaches to studying subjective experience and neuroimaging?
* naturalistic neuroimaging and inter-subject correlation (correlating time series across subjects)
	* use one subject's brain as a model for another (not related to task)
* individual variability in neural event segmentation
	* we carve out our life experience into discrete events, and we do this on the fly
	* task design: watch 4 films followed by self-appraisal
	* results: similarlity in how we think about a film is reflected in the neural representation across participants
	* similar segmentation leads to similar interpretation (outside scanner, behavioral event segmentation task)
	* neural boundaries in regions that reflet behavioral boundaries at the group level are also relevant for how that movie is ultimately remembered and appraised at the invidaul level. 
* what makes information social? (task - pictoral ToM, animations, social localizers etc.)
* social > non-social largely activate entire brain, including cerebellum (valerie & finn, 2022)
* people's own percepts do a better job at explaining their brain activation compared to the "true" label of the task
* "socialness" is in the eye of the beholder 
* develop a set of fully parameterized stimuli to rigourosly investigate how social percepts vary across individuals
	* parameterizing socialness
	* chase subtlety is parameterized
	* individual differences in social tuning curves are reliable across time
* neural activity tracks subjective percepts of socialness
* third visual pathway (emerges early in cortical hierarchy)
