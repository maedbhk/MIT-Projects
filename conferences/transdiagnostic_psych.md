## Atypical FC patterns in PDE (prenatal drug exposure)
* Neonate brain connectivity is disrupted by PDE
* Distinct and widespread regions differentially affected by timing
* neonatal connectivity predicts 12-month behavioral outcome
* early differences may alter trajectories of neonatal brain function over first year of life
* examining the timing of environmental factors provides insight into risk and resilience
* multimodal integration of brain-based measures is necssary 

## Braincharting autism and ADHD reveals age- and sex specific effects
* Saashi Bedford, PhD - University of Cambridge
* ASD: patterns of altered brain development
* Normative modeling: model relationhip between two variables in a typically development sample (e.g., pediatric growth charts)
* models must account for age / sex / scanner / site differences
* check bethlemen et al. (2022) brain growth chart work
* data: ABIDE, HBN, MRC etc. lifespan brain chart consortium
* ASD: more localized changes, ADHD: more distributed
* combined ASD + ADHD: distributed and stronger efects
* sex differences: sex x diagnosis interaction for ASD but not ADHD. localized to insula. 
* how do these groups change across development? 
	* intervals of 4 years, sliding by one year
* early brain overgrowth in ASD reflected in mean CT spike early in life
