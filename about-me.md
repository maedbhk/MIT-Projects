![](assets/images/profile_mk.png)

I'm an [Integrative Computational Neuroscience (ICoN) Fellow](https://yangtan.mit.edu/icon/) at MIT using computational approaches to identify biologically‐driven risk predictors of neurodevelopmental (e.g., ADHD) disorders, with a particular focus on the cerebellum.

I received my PhD from the University of California, Berkeley in 2022 where I used machine learning and statistics to build models of cerebellar function. 

I'm passionate about using my experience as an educator and academic mentor to communicate complex ideas to both non‐expert and expert audiences. I have a strong record of publishing in scientific journals and presenting at research conferences. I have also taught neuroscience to diverse audiences, from undergraduate students at UC Berkeley to incarcarated students at San Quentin State Prison. 

Finally, I strongly believe in using data‐driven solutions to formulate and recommend policy, especially as it pertains to mental health solutions.
