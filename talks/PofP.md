* 36% of all professors in US are women
* at MIT - 24% 2020 - science - women faculty

### work-life balance in academia: 
* panelists: debbie chachra; megan nunez; farmaz niroui
* flexibility
* at work, every minute counts
* harder to draw boundaries these days
* birth control + the 401k - what women have today.
* you can't spend your whole life waiting for life.

* learn to balance two objects before someone throws you a chainsaw

### what type of institution is right for you
* making a case for canada..
* small liberal arts schools: mentorship programs + close relationship with professors
* teach at a community college during postdoc?
* "how to each whtat you don't know" - book

### what type of institution is right for you
* indeed.com
* capd at MIT - workshops for going thru research statements
* you're looking to craft your own story
* your story is something you're going to build over a lifetime
* it's going to be hard to talk at length about something that doesn't interest you
* spending time in a postdoc is a unique opportunity to define your own research trajectory (separate from your mentor)
    * it's in your best interest to differentiate yourself early on, because of your mentor's PI
* hiring committee wants to be awakened:
    * what strikes the fire in your belly
    * good, clear crisp writing (person reading it will be happier)
    * is this an enthusiastic applicant? 
* who would you collaborate with in this department? 
* faculty are looking for colleagues

### applying
* always commmunicate with the chair of the search. ask who you are meeting
* interviews work both ways. you are interviewing the institution and the people who are part of it as much as they are interviewing you. 
* do your homework about the institution. take notes about every person you're going to meet, and prepare 1-2 questions to ask each person you are meeting with.
* be genuine and sincere. 
* you're lucky if your search committee has read most of your materials. do not assume that everyone knows everything already.

    * quite possible that the audience doesn't know your research - they might not have shared knowledge (first few slides, what's your research about)
* include slide on research trajectory, how current talk connects with future research, and dept of interview
* anticipate the questions and prepare answers for questions you may receive from the audience. 
* don't be shy in asking for help!!!
* nobody wants to see your life, they just want to see you as a scientist -- really?

    * have ideas on what classes you may teach in the dept (look at course website)
        * don't offer a class they've never taught before
    * think about thow your work intersects/aligns with others in the dept

* DON'T:
    * be over enthsiastic or too effusive in your praise
    * be too shy or silent at semi-social events (e.g., meals)
    * pretend to remember every detail you hear, take notes
    * compare the institution to your current or comparable instituion explicitly 
    * provide your "expert" opinion on methodology or science that contradicts your to-be colleagues
        * in response to "i already this" - respond diplomatically
        * i disagree with your x paper - respond diplomatically
* when you're interacting with faculty:
    * be interested in their research
    * good if you can ask an insightful question or two, point out area of overlap, potential collaboration
    * meetings with faculty, mgiht be focused on teaching or research
    * meals are less formal, but remember you are still being interviewed.

    * how big do you want your lab to be (students and square footage)
    * how much start-up funding do you need? do your homework; what are typical recent start-up requests for this type of instituion. make sure you can get what you need to be successful, but a completely out-of-line request could take you out of the competition. be sure you can justify everything you request. 
    * what salary do you want? do not give a specific number, say something like "i'm sure a potential offer would be a competitive salary"
* interactions with adminostrators/HR
* after the interview, send emails to everyone:
    * colleagues you met as well.
    * definitely the chair of the search committee
* can use "after the interview" as a delay tactic

### negotiating
* starts before you get the offer
* put together a spreadsheet and send it back and get feedback
* chair of the dept wants you to get everything you want, but they have to negotiate on your behalf. 
* will i be able to get tenure with this package? 
* will i be able to live on this salary? 
* do i actually want to work at this place?
* ask for summer pay 
* you don't need a partner in academia to negotiate
    * the university can help your partner elsewhere
* one-on-one advise for negotiating on handshake (capd)

### building a professional network and reputation
* walk through open doors and take advantage of new opportunities
* it's really important to have a single tag line that people can remember and take back with them
* ellen roche: make networking a part of your day-to-day rather than a chore
* flip a coin and whatever your gut reaction tells you is what you really feel
