> Many of these observations come from the following paper: [Spoto et al. 2021](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.655164/full)

* The human cerebellum develops over a long time, extending from early embryonic period until the first postnatal years. Most of its volume increases during the last trimester of pregnancy, which is considered a critical period for cerebellar development
* Last few months of gestation are the time during which the cerebellar nuclei start to form their major afferents and efferents from/to cerebral cortices and subcortical structures and this development continues during the first years after birth
* Developmental diaschisis idea: cerebellar connections with contralateral cerebral cortices (specifically DLPFC) are well established - an interruption of this circuit between areas of the CNS may determine a diaschisis - a functional impairment of the region linked to the one subject of a structural lesion
* Cerebellar injury in preterms:
    * Cerebellar underdevelopment (cerebellar atrophy/hypoplasia)
    * Destructive cerebellar lesions (primary and focal injury, hemorrhage or infarction)
    * What causes cerebellar underdevelopment in preterm babies?
    * Blood products (hemosiderin)
    * Perinatal glucocorticoid exposure
    * Opioids and pain
    * Inadequate nutrition
    * Infections
    * Inflammations
    * Hypoxic-ischemic insults
    * Cerebral brain injuries
    * socioeconomic status
* What causes destructive cerebellar lesions?	
    * Cerebellar hemorrhage
    * Cerebellar infarction
