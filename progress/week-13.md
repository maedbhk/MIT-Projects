## Done and To-Do
* Working with Alyson (Wellesley RA) and Lexi on a potential collaboration exploring the adaptive traits of ADHD. 
* questions we're exploring:
    * What is the relationship between ADHD and profession choice?
    * What professions are seen as “creative” (organizational psych) 
    * How does race/SES/gender play a role in these issues?
    * What role does IQ and severity of ADHD diagnosis play in all of these factors?
* working with Lexi to get access to phenotypic data on UK Biobank to explore ADHD in an adult population
* set-up a predictive modeling workflow that can now flexibly take in any combination of measures from the HBN dataset and predict a number of target variables [github repo](https://github.com/maedbhk/healthy_brain_network). worked on documentation of repo to take it easier for RAs to access data and run models, also wrote-up openmind tutorial [here](../mentorship/openmind.md)
