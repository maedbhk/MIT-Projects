title: Week 3

* One of the projects that I'm interested in starting addresses the role of the cerebellum in neurodevelopmental disorders. Therefore, I've been reading up on [cerebellar development](../literature-review/cerebellum-development.md) this week and a few papers struck me as particularly interesting:
    * [Sathyanesan et al. 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-019-0152-2)
    * [Stevenson et al. 2014](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/34/3/691)
    * [Tran et al. 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-18316-8)
    * [Tiemeier et al. 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811909008933?via%3Dihub)
* I've also been exploring [precision medicine/pHealth](../literature-review/pHealth-other-fields.md) in other fields, namely genomics, as a way to understand the evoluation of this discipline.
* Although I haven't delved into it much yet, I want to curate a set of guidelines that address [ethical considerations](../literature-review/pHealth-ethics.md) in the work that we're doing. My goal is that others can also contribute to this list. 
* I liked this review paper by [Woo et al. (2017)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4478/) a lot. They trace the progress and limitations of translational neuroimaging, offering a roadmap for future utility in precision medicine, focusing on diagnostic value of models, scalability and deployability, and generalizability. I also hadn't encountered the idea of process-based predictive models before, but it's compelling to me if we're going to move beyond DSM-categorization of mental illness to RDoC-like constructs across disorders. I note some of the paper's key points [here](../literature-review/translational-neuroimaging.md)
