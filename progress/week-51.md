	* Ran some of the additional models we discussed in Monday meeting. 
* Meeting on precision medicine for Vol. V of MIT SPR - [notes here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZOotcUi8juzPprwSyobazz-5I47bqZc37Q3K8CnTV-o/edit?usp=sharings)
* Worked on research statement and DEI statement - not ready yet for feedback.
* Submitted [abstract](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dp5oi2crm1NUOdr0XwILg8npf_JuRYABKYiPho-AwS8/edit?usp=sharings) to OHBM for symposium on cortico-cerebellar connectivity (part of panel with Sheeba Anteraper)
* Updated HBN models wrt reading impairment and sent to Ola so that she can start writing before the holidays.
* Some reading I've been doing: [sex differences and the cerebellum](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12311-008-0003-6) and a new [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01501-6) that looks at growth curves in subcortex (no cerebellum though) - they compiled a great pediatric dataset from 0-6 years, I emailed the corresponding author to enquire about cerebellar coverage.

## To Do
* Finish research + DEI statement to have enough time for feedback before holidays
* Finish running CHOP models before holidays
