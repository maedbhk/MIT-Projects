## Done and To-Do
* HBN item analysis:
    * Worked on item analysis of HBN data testing out [tf-idf](https://towardsdatascience.com/tf-idf-for-document-ranking-from-scratch-in-python-on-real-world-dataset-796d339a4089) and [distance correlation](https://dcor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) on questions and answers
    * applied hierarchical clustering to answer and question matrices, separately for each question
    * rewrote some old scripts to preprocess questionnaire data to make item analysis more parsimonious
* Literature review:
    * spent some time reading up on the diagnosis/questionnaire literature to identify similar constructs across measures
    * [Hampel et al 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166223622002582)
    * [Morin et al. 1999](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1022986728576)
    * [Langley et al. 2013](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15374416.2013.817311)
    * [Reed et al 2015](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10862-014-9439-9)
* Rerunning all models (again) including [smote](https://machinelearningmastery.com/smote-oversampling-for-imbalanced-classification/) and new feature sets. Also tested out [LOFO](https://github.com/aerdem4/lofo-importance)
