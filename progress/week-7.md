title: Week 7

### Done
* meeting heavy week! 
* Hired 3 UROP candidates for two positions, recruited one student from Wellesley to work on research methods, and hired 2 from MIT for computational positions. 
* Read some papers on [development and translational neuroimaging](../literature-review/development-translational-neuroimaging.md) and I'm thinking about applying an artificial neural network to the phenotypic data, taking a similar approach to [Siugzdaite et al. (2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982220301585).
* spent some time reading up on [model interpretability](../methods/model-interpretability.md) from [this useful website](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/scope-of-interpretability.html).
* Started reading literature related to suicidality and self-harm as it pertains to the [CHOP collaboration](../projects/chop.md)
* have "finalized" a script for extracting features and running classifier and regression models using pydra-ml. Talked to claudia who has been working on something similar, gave her some pointers and hopefully some of my more successful models will be useful for her work, benchmarking them against her diffusion models for example. 
* haven't been having a huge amount of success visualizing meaningful embeddings for phenotypic data using umap
* attended first of 3 openmind tutorials, although not necessary for current project, want to get some practice at building singularity containers


### questions/feedback
* we had a neuroimaging meeting today and were discussing a centralized database to keep track of datasets, how to access them on openmind, whether they have been bids-ified etc. there were two suggestions for doing this: the gablab wiki on openmind or a page on sensein github. with both of these options, everyone in the lab would be able to contribute - do you have any preference?
* we also talked about having access to each other's repos for projects we're currently working, not everyone (including me) have public repos for their ongoing projects (number of reasons for this) - one suggestion was that we make our repos public within the sensein github org. currently, we're sharing snippets of code via slack instead of pointing to the scripts on our repos. 
* Related to ^^, could I be added as a member of the senesein github organization?
