## Done and To Do
* Worked on CHOP project on arcus until Thursday
    * preprocessed precovid data. need to harmonize precovid + postcovid data but first need insight into how data are created (are different questionnaires used etc?)
    * access to arcus was revoked on thursday, arranged meeting with scott to figure out how to resolve issue
* Met with kseniia on tuesday to discuss item analysis project that we're doing with Kai (summer UROP), brainstormed some ideas:
    * construct search on HBN data that can be generalized to other datasets
    * identify unique cognitive profiles for each participant and compare question + response data
* Worked with Kai on item analysis project, all notebooks are saved in this [github repo](https://github.com/maedbhk/item_analysis/tree/KM_urop_work)
    * aim is to have Kai present his results at the end of his summer UROP (mid-August)
* Didn't work on ADHD + gender paper this week as much as I anticipated, hopefully will get to it next week
    * Instead, I had to rework review paper this week. First draft submitted to journal [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1POf-AnrN9fjfmp2Wl_OoDTvSJH01mw-V/view?usp=sharing)
