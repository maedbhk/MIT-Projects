## Done and To-Do
* Meeting with Jaan about [ClinicalBERT](../methods/modeling-EHR.md), notes [here](https://www.figma.com/file/UWscQm187lLMGmhnLdBS0A/221019-maedbh-jaan?node-id=0%3A1). 
* We chatted about:
    * (1) building dashboards for predictive models that can help clinicians (e.g. displaying the data using https://superset.apache.org/)
    * (2) simple models that can help detect features predictive of suicide attempt
    * (3) longer-term strategy for deploying models that work across EHR data structured in different ways, in different health systems
* To Do: connect with people at CHOP about [OMOP common data model](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/)
* Spoke with Thea Singer about a profile for the Rappaport Foundation proposal
* Updated phenotypic models with feature and permutation importances. Notebook is [here](../notebooks/phenotype_models.html)
    * still having difficulty loading the images -- need to figure this out. 
* Put together a short proposal/presentation for CHOP meeting, will present in Monday meeting

## Questions
* Training and test data for predictive modeling: all participants or filter for particular disorders?
* Can we ask CHOP collaborators for more unstructured data for clinicalBERT model?
