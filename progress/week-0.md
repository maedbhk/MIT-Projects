## Motivation for doing postdoctoral work as an ICoN fellow
The projects that I undertook during my PhD were aligned with the goals of basic
science research. Specifically, I used task-based fMRI data to build predictive models of the
cerebellum, with the goal of understanding its role in cognitive function. I primarily used
neuroimaging methods and techniques to build these models, however, along the way, I
recognized the utility of incorporating other modalities, namely transcriptomics, behavior,
and neuropsychology to address my research questions. For example, I worked with gene
samples from the Allen Human Brain Atlas, and although the data were sparse for the
cerebellum, it allowed me to imagine another lens by which I could investigate cerebellar
functional organization. I was also involved in two patient studies that were particularly
impactful for me. Both projects were collaborations between multiple research groups
invested in testing a novel theory of cerebellar function. In multiple experiments, we tested
patients with cerebellar degeneration (e.g. spinocerebellar ataxia) on a series of tightly
controlled behavioral experiments instead of simple clinical batteries. It was my first
experience interacting with patient populations for the purposes of scientific research, and it
motivated me to seriously consider the potential of translating basic science research,
across multiple modalities, into patient-centered healthcare outcomes.

I am excited at the prospect of pursuing an ICoN computational fellowship in the
Ghosh and Gabrieli research groups for multiple reasons. First, regardless of where my
career takes me, I am keen to use the expertise I cultivated during my PhD to work on
large-scale and innovative projects that exist at the intersection of health sciences,
technology, and data science. Second, I am eager to work in a highly collaborative
environment under the leadership of ICoN center faculty members. One of the appeals of
the fellowship is that there are very clear overall objectives that are shared across the
faculty, research scientists, and postdocs, all of whom are contributing unique skill sets and
expertise to the work. Third, I will have the opportunity to extensively build my knowledge
across a wide range of areas: clinical assessment, endophenotyping, advanced machine
learning models, and cross-integration of multiple modalities (e.g. behavior, transcriptomics,
neuroimaging, video/speech analysis). 
<br>
Finally, it is an exciting time to work in precision
medicine, and although there is an abundance of data and computing power, what is lacking
are models of individual human behavior that can inform risk predictors of health. Therefore,
the prospect of working in collaboration with the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia is
incredibly compelling as it facilitates the development of behavioral tests whilst
simultaneously evaluating diagnostic models in a continuous fashion. Importantly, any
collaboration with clinicians will keep patient wellbeing at the forefront of our work.

## Project Goals
One of the goals of the Ghosh/Gabrieli lab is to develop biologically-driven 
risk predictors and monitors of mental health. This will be done using multi-modal
datasets that correlate genetic information with clinical evaluations through endophenotypes
learned from neuroimaging, behavior, actigraphy signals and speech/vocal recordings.
Mental health disorders encompass an enormous landscape of behavioral symptoms
and clinical assessment. To start, I would be interested in narrowing the scope to a set of
symptoms that can be assessed across multiple modalities. Perserverative behavior is a
symptom that underlies numerous mental health disorders, including ADHD, OCD, autism,
and schizophrenia, and it is measurable via multiple modalities. For example, perseveration
has been studied using fMRI and is thought to be the consequence of frontal failure to
modulate striatal outputs during controlled, purposive action, resulting in the continued
reselection of previously activated outputs (Shallice, 1988). Another modality that has been
used to study preservation is behavior. Cognitive tasks including the Wisconsin Card
Sorting task and the Trail Making task, have been leveraged to study perseveration in
typical and atypical development (Benitz et al. 2016). More recently, novel tools have been
developed that automate the labeling of effector movement, gaze, and facial expression in
real time using technology like deeplabcut and mediapipe. This technology could potentially
allow us to identify perseverative behaviors across adult and developmental populations. It
is possible to imagine combining live and longitudinal information from large-scale video
and speech datasets to build prognostic computational models that identify and predict
perseverative behaviors across a large range of mental health disorders. Furthermore,
based on what we already know from neuroimaging and behavior, we could validate these
models using biologically-driven data that include large-scale networks of the cortex and
subcortex, and behavioral variation.
<br>
In the context of this project, I am particularly interested in the following questions (posed in
the original proposal):

* Considering the practicalities of precision healthcare, should we expect
neuroimaging data to be incorporated into every individual’s health care
assessment? To what extent does brain imaging even improve prognostic
applications? Large scale cortical and subcortical networks have provided us
with valuable insights about brain organization and topography in both
healthy and patient populations, however, it is not clear what role these data
will play in diagnostic applications. Will we be able to reliably identify macro
circuits that drive behavioral (and genetic) variation? And if so, will we be able
to use these circuits to inform predictive and diagnostic models of mental
illness?

* How good are behavioral assessments? Are there cognitive tasks that better
capture symptoms compared to self-report clinical questionnaires. This is a
question that we have been exploring in the motor world, specifically in the
context of identifying cognitive impairments in patients with cerebellar
degeneration. Subtle deficits are often masked by self-report questionnaires,
and are then only revealed in carefully controlled behavioral experiments that
test very specific cognitive processes.

* I also believe there is great scope to automate the analysis of human
behavior to aid psychiatric diagnoses. Some of this work is already underway
in the motor world (e.g., automating clinical assessment of spinocerebellar
ataxia and Parkinson’s disease). I can imagine building models that identify
symptoms of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g.,
perseveration, hyperfocus, task switching etc.) on continuous and longitudinal
video data collected in naturalistic settings. These models of complex
behavior could then be validated by biologically-driven data and used to
inform clinical tools that are then adopted by healthcare professionals.

## Other considerations
* Finally, there are a number of ethical considerations that I would like to consider as I
venture into the realm of precision medicine. Translational work is a new area of research
for me and I am aware that precision medicine is a quickly evolving field that raises
important questions about ethical responsibility:
* Data privacy: Who stands to benefit, and who is harmed? What possible solutions
help protect individuals’ and communities’ ownership over their own data? I think this
question is especially relevant for neural data that is not (as of yet) being used to
track, manipulate, or identify individuals.
* AI and healthcare: with such heavy reliance on technology in developed nations, I
think it’ll be important to consider the concerns associated with bias and morality of
AI, and how it may actually challenge equitable access to healthcare.
* Communicating uncertainty: How do we communicate uncertainty about our
translational results, especially when models are continuously updated with new
information. It’ll be important to understand the uncertainty arising from technical
procedures: small/incomplete sample sizes, sparse longitudinal datasets, instrument
variability etc.
* To what extent can we engage with diverse communities in translating neuroscience
research to the health space. Can we bring together neuroscientists, physicians,
ethicists, engineers, mental health workers, and caregivers to understand the ethical
impact of data- and model-driven precision medicine?
