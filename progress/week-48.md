title: Week 48
---

11/06 - 11/10

## Done and To Do
* Spent most of the week working on CHOP project, tasks included: 
    * moving code over from lab 1 to lab 2
    * writing SQL functions to extract relevant variables from lab 2 datasets and saving data to csv files
    * reorganized lab 2 repo to make it more flexible for running ML pipeline (takes in feature, target, and participant spec files that can be easily configuarable)
    * rewrote train/test splits so that we're balancing across sex, race, and suicide attempt
    * did a basic summary including the new BHS data (we now have data up until Apr. 2023)
    * unfortunately, everything takes a bit longer in the virtual machine (it's glitchy and requires rebooting often)
* Met with Elina, Harsha and Meryem about CHOP project. Meeting notes [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jrd4adwyYcNr7YE6sZ_ED3tnjrsCMtzCHlmqZIYbK0c/edit?usp=sharing)
* Did some work on OHBM poster with Yibei
    * Mostly identifying subject groups + other relevant phenotypic information for inclusion in analysis
* I've been appointed as lead author on an MIT Science Policy Review paper, which will focus on Precision Medicine. Met with the team this week - meeting notes [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lIXncvrkcZ4unGfFcGDp2uy08Qw0mDu4U9JDzRR6aGw/edit?usp=sharing)
* Met with [Ran Rotem](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/weisskopf-lab/members/ran-rotem/) from Marc Weisskopf's group at Harvard to discuss a potential collaborator on the developing cerebellum. Meeting notes [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-BTiIVrMmZf0nfqk2XjEYWF0rbNtSwEuFHn02-Wdy1M/edit?usp=sharing)
* Did some reading on the [SCPAB Transition to Independence Award](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/grant/scpab-transition-to-independence-award/?swcfpc=1) and I think I'm interested in applying. Deadline is rather soon (mid-January) so will need to get working on the application soon.
