## Done and To-Do
* worked with Shreya on running new phenotypic models to incorporate categorical features (using [dirtycat](https://dirty-cat.github.io/stable/)) and testing on different classifiers, models were taking a long time to run, spent some time troubleshooting ways to reduce run time, reducing number of splits helped + parallelizing code
* Played around with [chatGPT for gender differences and ADHD paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nxVdqlk8y7OQJrOZduDnKe4XjOBfrdEnLuoHE0DTy1c/edit?usp=sharing)
    * met with Alyson to discuss [paper draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oyEfqOItJlEwB2m_4i6zd9fny3PMar4LHf8UdQQZ93s/edit?usp=sharing). I'm working on putting results blocks together and she's working on the write-up
    * talked about [expected gender differences across HBN measures](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xfgBdCQtCCxKX8C84T_UiUoX-HcjOg6p3NVxC2ImMPw/edit) - compiling information about each measure from the literature
    * discussed diagnostic bias vs. gender differences? need to come up with a good method to address whether the former is true
