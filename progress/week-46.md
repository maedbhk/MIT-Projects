## Done and To Do
* Reached out to Ran Rotem about possible collaboration exploring prenatal determinants of mental health disorders
    * he gave a talk at the Picower conference on determinants of mental health
    * he used EHR and found that maternal hypothyroidism is associated with increased risk for asd in their children
    * my question is: can we identify an association between cerebellar injury prenatally (or shortly after birth) and later diagnosis of ASD? Structural neuroimaging work, and animal models have suggested that this association exists but no study has yet to leverage large-scale EHR data to corroborate this finding. 
* Met with Kseniia and Kai about item analysis project, trying out the following:
    * 
* Ran new HBN models on reading impairment data -- answered some of the questions that Ola outlined
* Made progress on ADHD paper
* To Do: access to Arcus has not yet been resolved so haven't been able to work on it this week
