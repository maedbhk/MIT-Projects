title: Week 10

## Done and To Do
* Set up a meeting with Jaan about [clinicalBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05342). Largely addresses unstructured data such as physician notes included as part of a patient's EHR. 
* Got a general understanding of the [BHS data](../literature-review/EMR-selfharm.md) that we will have access to from CHOP. Ran also sent along a dictionary that gives a bit more detail. However, he confirmed with me this week that we should wait until the next meeting to discuss data access. Based on the information that I have (from the paper and the dictionary), I can put together a project proposal that we can discuss in the group meeting. 
* Results from predictive modeling of hbn phenotypic data (including feature importance) are updated [here](../notebooks/phenotype_models.html). Next steps on this front is to identify a core (uncorrelated) set of questionnaires that have predictive power. This has potential to be of practical use. 
* Didn't get around to starting on naturalistic data from HBN - that will a task for next week. 
* All research assistants have started on their [projects](../mentorship/weekly-notes.md) and are set up on [OpenMind](../mentorship/openmind.md)
* I want to adopt some of the methodology from [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982220301585), which I summarize [here](../literature-review/development-translational-neuroimaging.md) to the hbn data, particularly the application of ANNs to both cognitive profiles and morphological and connectivity data
