title: Week 1

## Overview
* Spent time familiarizing myself with software and tools that are used in sensein lab (e.g., datalad) and mcgovern (openmind)
* Explored datasets and applied for access to NIMH, UK Biobank, and CHOP. Talked with Hoda about UK Biobank, will meet in person soon. Need to contact Steve and/or Debbie (have not met them yet). 
Available info on UK Biobank and ABCD is pretty comprehensive, need more details about CHOP (will know more when I get access).
* Have been reading the precision medicine literature, familiarizing myself more with recent developments in the field
* Plan on compiling a set of papers relating to neuroethics that I think will be pertinent to future projects (especially CHOP-related project) 

## Software/Tools
* [Datalad](https://neurohackademy.org/course/data-management-for-neuroimaging-with-datalad/)
    * how many datasets are currently hosted on datalad? 
* [Openmind](https://openmind.mit.edu/)
    * got an account + took the course. I've used slurm a lot previously (used savio cluster at berkeley and I'm familiar with submitting jobs, running bash scripts etc.
* [Singularity](https://apptainer.org/user-docs/3.8/index.html)
    * are there any general-use singularity containers on openmind for common neuroimaging preprocessing? (fMRIPrep, freesurfer etc.)
* [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)
* [Reproschema](https://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema)

## Project Ideas
* [Cerebellum and neuropsychiatric disorders](../projects/cerebellum_neuropsych.md)
* COVID-19 and the cerebellum
* [Cerebellum and development](../projects/cerebellum_development.md)
* [Predicting self-harm from hospital longitudinal EMR data](../projects/chop.md)
