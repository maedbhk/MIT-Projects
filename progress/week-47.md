title: Week 47
---

11/02 - 11/03

## Done and To Do
* Started back working officially yesterday (Nov. 2nd)
    * Spent most of the day yesterday reorganizing code base for HBN and reading project
    * Need to rerun some models before sending next set of results to Ola from Gablab - want to get this project off my desk asap
* I've been meeting on-and-off with Yibei during my leave to work on ADHD + neuroimaging project
    * Meeting with her today to go over preliminary results and to write OHBM abstract
* Over the next 3 weeks (before CHOP meeting) - I'll be working on this project. 
    * Next week, I'm meeting with Elina to touch base on lab 2 -- I will need to bring over code from lab 1 to lab 2. Not sure yet how much of the codebase will need to be restructured.
    * I'll also touch base with Harsha about LLM and lab 1, and whether there are any embeddings that we can use for modeling of BHS data.
* During my leave, I didn't have much of a chance to code/write (turns out newborns are very demanding...) but I had some time to think about current and future projects. I've detailed some of those thoughts [here](../projects/projects_status_Nov2023.md)

## Questions:
* Could we set up a biweekly meeting? For the month of November, I plan on being in person on Tuesdays and Fridays (although I'll try and take meetings in person so could vary), otherwise I can meet remotely any time.
