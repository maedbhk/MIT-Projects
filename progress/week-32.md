title: Week 32
---

03/27 - 03/31

## Done and To Do
* more administrative work this week than anticipated:
    * lots of one-on-one meetings with RAs and graduate students looking for advice etc. ended up taking more time than anticipated
    * spent some time writing letters of recommendation for current (and former) RAs
    * reviewed 2 papers and started writing an article on cerebellum connectivity for a journal's invited issue
* writing (and changing) results block for ADHD + sex differences paper
* HBN phenotypes: experimenting with different models + model parameters: [SMOTE vs No SMOTE](../notebooks/Parent_Feature_Importance-Smote.html); including comorbidites as variable (not a good idea); [LOFO models](../notebooks/Teacher_LOFO_Importance.html); full-feature models vs. assessment models; decision tree classifier vs. logistic regression (both do similarly)
