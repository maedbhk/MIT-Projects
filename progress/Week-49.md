title: Week 49
---

11/13 - 11/17

## Done
* CHOP Project - get models running on arcus with updated dataset
	* merged pre and post covid dataframes (took way longer than it should have)
	* working within VM is frustrating, glitchy and slow. Contacted arcus and talked to them, working on a fix. 
* HBN + Reading - got updated models running. Ended up doing a lot of reorganizing of code base to make it more flexible, which took longer than anticipated. Basically needed to update the code so that we're taking particpants who have given diagnosis (across any of the DX diagnoses, not just DX_01). Choosing which participants to include in models isn't trivial given large number of comorbidities. 
* Started working on Simons Foundation Fellowship
	* [Research Statement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11tN_wyjNd7JZqr8LWFozB9awJmIdCwCBA8uOJOr-_BA/edit) - currently in bullet points
	* [Diversity and Equity Statement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c1LPOYZZDGxb8D9aqdNcuaEsqmypS7KafFh0GEp_xc4/edit) - currently in bullet points
* Sent emails to profs in Europe enquiring about upcoming TT advertisements
	* Dagmar Timmann; Narendar Ramnani; Chris De Zeeuw.
* Chatted with Kseniia about writing a short paper on the semantic similarity work that Kai did during summer UROP. Likely won't get started on this until new year.
* Hopefully meeting Jeremy early next week (tbd) to discuss ideas about pediatric cerebellar project. Let me know if you're interested in joining, otherwise I will update you.

## To Do and Questions
* Full draft of research statement and DEI Statement. If you have some time, I would appreciate any feedback (once I have a first draft - hopefully end of next week)
* Send emails to mentors/collaborators requesting refs for Simons Foundation fellowship
* Update CHOP presentation with model results of lab 2 (before thanksgiving)
* I've been invited to present two talks at OHBM 2024:  "Gradients of Brain Organisation" workshop and a symposium on "Mapping cortical-subcortical interactions" (the latter is currently a proposal). I was wondering whether there would be funding for me to go? Of course, I recognize that I would have to present on current work, which means I would focus the next few months on a cerebellar imaging project. One of the symposia organizers asked me to discuss ideas presented in this [recent paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352154623000554) so I was thinking that it would be a good opportunity to present ideas in this paper + preliminary results on cerebellar imaging and neurodevelopment. Let me know what you think!
