* Worked on calculating distance correlations between HBN questionnaires to determine how orthogonal featuers are within a questionnaire
    * what is the redundancy across measures used to diagnose neurodevelopmental disorders?
* Worked with Opalina on her project to identify differences in cognitive performance across ADHD subtypes
    * Experimented with radar plots and parallel coordinates plots to visualize multivariate data
* Focused on Child Behavior Checklist across ADHD subtypes and differences in reporting between parents and teachers
* Attended an interesting [lecture](../literature-review/SCSB_Colloquium_Series.md) on interactions between the immune system during pregnancy and later diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders 
    * pregnancy-related features (e.g. nicotine use during pregnancy) are captured in the HBN dataset, could be interesting to examine importance of these features in diagnosis classification
