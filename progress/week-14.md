title: Week 14
---

* Worked with Lexi and Alyson on ADHD + adaptation project  
    * Alyson focused on ADHD across a few demographic variables: gender (e.g., ADHD subtypes inattentive vs. hyperactive (boys vs. girls)), SES (Low SES associated with higher exposure to environmental risk factors), and race (Cultural + ethnic factors influence perception, reponse, diagnosis, and treatment of ADHD)
    * Challenge in categorizing high vs low creative jobs, more literature establishing low vs high attainment jobs. 
* Predictive modeling of HBN data - certain questionnaires/measures are better at classifying whether or not someone has a diagnosis compared to no diagnosis (e.g., ADHD, Anxiety, Depression, ASD, Reading Impairment). Notebooks are here:
    * [ADHD](../notebooks/phenotype_models_ADHD.ipynb)
    * [ASD](../notebooks/phenotype_models_ASD.ipynb)
    * [Anxiety](../notebooks/phenotype_models_Anxiety.ipynb)
    * [Depression](../notebooks/phenotype_models_Depression.ipynb)
    * [Learning Impairment](../notebooks/phenotype_models_Learning_Disorder_with_Impairment_in_Reading.ipynb)
    * [Model Comparison](../notebooks/phenotype_models_compare.ipynb)
