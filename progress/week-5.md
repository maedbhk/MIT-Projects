### Done

### To Do
* First pass using UMAP unsupervised learning on child measures (cognitive testing, physical fitness features etc.)
* Try UMap in supervised mode to identify unique patterns in phenotypic data
* Questions to address: 
    * Within HBN assessment battery, which tests are most useful? (how does this vary across disorders?)
    * can further subtyping of individuals be done based on patterns in behavioral/cognitive assessments? (especially for 200 people who were not diagnosed due to an incomplete evaluation)
    * what is the reliability in the KSADS assessment across child and parent measures?
* Test python implementation of SUIT on subset (n=10) of hbn participants (T1w + T2)
* Perform VBM to measure local changes in structural abnormalities, following methods steps implemented in [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158218303012) - correcting for brain size etc.
