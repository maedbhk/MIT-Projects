## Done and To-Do
* Re ran hbn models including age as a feature (it does make a difference for some)

* added new results to hbn paper draft (very tentative) - compiling relevant references (+ papers to read)

* worked on results block for adhd + gender differences paper - ran new models for males and females separately (to determine which measures best classify adhd subtypes, and whether there are differences across males/females)

* wrote a job description for the item analysis project (response similarity across questionnaires) — then talked to Sooyoung who expressed interest as it is a good machine learning project + has reproschema component (e.g, putting HBN data dictionaries into standardized format)

* read some transdiagnostic papers (will link them later)

* started looking into ABCD phenotypic data — will focus on cbcl for now
