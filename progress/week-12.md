## Done and To-Do
* Attended the precision psychiatry conference on Weds/Thurs - some notes [here](../talks/precision-psychiatry-conference.md)
* Met with Lexi about a potential collaboration w/r/t adaptivity and ADHD. Alyson (Wellesley RA) has put together a literature review on this topic, you can check out her work [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1trw6-ZadnwV8cDS9RsteWeWROG77_8Qc?usp=sharing)
    * In short, the idea is to investigate adaptive traits and attributes that are often overlooked in people diagnosed with ADHD. There is a literature (albeit sparse) that proposes an evolutionary theory of ADHD, namely that it is maintained in the population due to selection forces that convey advantages. Some thoughts/notes on the topic will soon be available [here](../projects/adaptive-ADHD.md)
* Presented at lab meeting, slides are [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aVcPZ3PS7W07UKi56f0eyAiuBs9oKdIUvq4w7Zn78is/edit?usp=sharing)
* Shreya (MIT RA) and I have been working on building more models on the HBN data focusing now on the different disorder groups (e.g., ADHD, ASD etc.). The results will be available in an interactve notebook soon 
* Opaline (MIT RA) has been working on a dashboard using apache superset, currently replicating the [summary results](../notebooks/clinical_dx.html) from HBN, but I think this approach could also be useful for CHOP project
* Attend the cross-collaboration Child Mind meeting on cross-species connectivity and autism, my only complaint was that they didn't include the cerebellum in their analyses!
* I've been reading some of the papers that Ran shared, and next week, I'll start updating the [CHOP meeting presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cMuZlhUnwq-EIToNcuGfgmiw9WlnGjoFWv1HwfP2bwU/edit?usp=sharing) with specific questions/methods. I want to have a first draft ready before our next meeting at the end of the month. 

## Questions
* can you add me to the google drive so that I can upload lab meeting slides?
