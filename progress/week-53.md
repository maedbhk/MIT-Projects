## done and todo
* Finished this latest round of results for reading project
    * results [here]
    * next iteration of results, need to:
        * Two possible stories: 1: student measures outperform parent/teacher measures (esp. early in development) and 2:  there are sex biases in how well measures predict diagnosis (we know this from ADHD and ASD diagnosis)
        * To do: understand what features are most predictive (if we are using individual items or some sort of clustering) across the ages, and what explains sex differences. Finally, we could explore who are the people for whom models do best and for whom they fail. Similar idea to [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05118-w)
* tentative research statement [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t5YYfak20qdoQnIU_nsF-4D_CYqK3TJaqqnBBH2zcRs/edit?usp=sharing)
