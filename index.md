## Welcome

![](assets/images/coverphoto_mk.png)

In an attempt to document my projects, from conception to publication, I'm compiling project ideas, 
and weekly progress in one place as a reference template for myself and for anyone interested in 
what I'm doing in my work as an ICoN Fellow at MIT.
