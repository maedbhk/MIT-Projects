## The Senseable Intelligence Group at MIT is hiring Two Research Assistants
**Apply By:** 09/20/’22
**Start Date**: 10/01/’22 (ends Spring 2023, extension possible thru summer 2023) 
**Compensation**: Course/Academic Credit
**Group**: Sensible Intelligence Group, McGovern Institute, MIT
**Key Words**: Python Programming; Big Data; Literature Review; Data Science; Neuroimaging; Neurodevelopmental Disorders
**Project Title**: Using big data to build predictive models of developmental disorders

**Project Overview**
The Senseable Intelligence Group at the McGovern Institute for Brain Research is looking for UROP candidates to work on cutting-edge and clinically relevant neuroscience research. The aim of the project is to build computational models that integrate biological and behavioral information to develop risk predictors of neurodevelopmental disorders.

**__We are looking to fill TWO separate roles:__**
**Role 1)** This role requires strong computational/programming expertise, and involves training and testing models on a multi-modal dataset that includes phenotypic assessments and brain-based markers.
**Role 2)** This role requires previous experience in conducting literature reviews and writing brief reports. The research topics will range from neurodevelopmental disorders to translational neuroimaging and precision medicine. Knowledge of these topics is not required, but an interest in this research is highly encouraged.

**__Prerequisites__**
(Role 1): Proficiency in Python programming, some machine learning and data science is required. (Role 2): Basic research methods along with an ability to conduct a literature review is required. Foundational knowledge of psychology/cognition and neuroscience is highly preferred but not required.

**__How to Apply__**
Please send a statement of interest along with an updated resume to maedbh@mit.edu, using the subject title Fall 2022 UROP. As there are two openings for this project, please indicate in your application which (or both) of the two roles appeals most to you.
