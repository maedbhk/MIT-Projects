### Work Expectations/Preferences
* 10-12 hours per week (daily schedule is up to you)
* Weekly updates on Friday mornings detailing (bullet point list): what you've done, what you're planning, any questions/blockers
* You can work in-person (46-5094) or remotely, whichever you wish.
* Bimonthly meetings (or weekly if you prefer) - could do one hour meetings every two weeks or 30 min meetings every week
* End of semester write-up: present summary of what you researched at the end of the semester
* Fill out [mentorship agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11-YwvIdT35Qg0uNtHOTi5Hje1feyRdoV/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110847987931723045299&rtpof=true&sd=true) within 15 days of starting

### Reading Papers (most relevent for Role 2)
* Do you use a reference management software: paperpile, mendeley etc? 
* This project draws on multiple fields, therefore the literature review will be at the intersection of neuroimaging methods, translational neuroimaging, neuropsychiatric disorders, and development. 
* For tips on writing a good research paper (should also be helpful in reading papers too), see [Mensch & Kording's paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005619).

* For guidelines on how to quickly and efficiently read a research paper

* questions you can ask yourself as you're reading a paper

### Getting oriented to the project
* Brief overview of the project can be found (here)[../projects/cerebellum-fingerprints.md] - includes links to papers that are relevents
* some [terminology](../literature-review/pHealth-terminology.md) and an [overview](../literature-review/pHealth-overview.md) of precision medicine (or pHealth) that you may find useful and some [ethical considerations](../literature-review/pHealth-ethics.md) related to precision medicine
* One goal of your work will be to identify research that is relevent to the current project, and to draw on existing literature to generate questions that are pertinent to current project
* one starting place will be to review articles that use the healthy brain network dataset.
