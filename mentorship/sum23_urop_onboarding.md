### Technical Onboarding

## Doing Research
* Shell, git and other useful skills: https://missing.csail.mit.edu/ 
* python, stats, machine learning, deep learning, nlp: Daniel's resources [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/127Npk6Z2gV-p_ewwnRz7qDyvKKRI6vb6Yg3zKnOw16s/edit)
* For tips on writing a good research paper (should also be helpful in reading papers too), see [Mensch & Kording's paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005619).
* For guidelines on how to quickly and efficiently read a research paper
* [questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C0BIUCnRUMB4GxSYUCGDSiff4WHgi4aK1XJ11zEYIjM/edit?usp=sharing) you can ask yourself as you're reading a paper

## OpenMind: cluster where we store data and run scripts
* Request openmind account + do course to get access and post certificate on [OpenMind github](https://github.mit.edu/MGHPCC/OpenMind/wiki/Getting-started)
    * Account Request Example: Attn @s-b,@djarecka: "maedbh maedbh@mit.edu" PI: Satrajit Ghosh
    * Verify which groups you're part of on openmind by typing `groups`: you should see `om_sig` and `gablab`. `om_sig` is Satra Ghosh's group and `gablab` is John Gabrieli's group.
* Follow instructions on [openmind setup](openmind.md) for getting starting on openmind (bash scripts etc.)
    * [openmind website](https://openmind.mit.edu/): this provides generic pointers to various elements of openmind, the link to FAQs is particularly useful.

## Projects:
* [Item analysis of questionnaires](../projects/item_analysis.md)
