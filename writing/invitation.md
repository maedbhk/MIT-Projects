Re: An invitation to contribute a short review for Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences

Dear Maedbh,

Wietske van der Zwaag and I have been invited by Editors-in-Chief, Cindy Lustig and Trevor W. Robbins, to
edit an issue of Elsevier’s Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences on the theme of “Role of the
Cerebellum in Cognition and Behavior”. A brief introduction to our vision for this issue is included at the
end of this message for context.

We are inviting several our colleagues around the world to contribute to this issue and given your
expertise and reputation we very much hope that you will be willing to contribute a short review. We’d
like to suggest that your review covers "Cerebellum as part of a network," but the exact scope and title
will be shaped by you. We just ask for any proposed change to the general scope of your review to be
discussed with us to ensure consistency and balance in the overall content of the issue.
Your contribution would consist of a short narrative review of approximately 2000 words, and it would
ideally focus on interesting and relevant articles (no more than 50) published recently in the field. We
would like you to annotate a few of the most important references in the bibliography of your review, as
this is a key feature of the journal.
You are welcome to invite additional co-authors if you wish, but we ask that you remain the senior
author.

Manuscripts will be due by May 31, 2023 and all accepted articles will be available online and fully
citable between acceptance and final compilation of the issue. If this deadline is prohibitive to your
acceptance, please let us know and we will do our best to accommodate extension requests.
This is an informal invitation from us as editors; upon acceptance, you will receive a follow up email
from Aqsa Jabeen (Editorial Manager at Elsevier, in copy) containing additional information to help with
your submission.

Wietske and I hope you are willing to contribute to what we think will be an outstanding volume that
focuses on our current understanding of the theme. Kindly let us know.

Best regards,
Sheeba Anteraper

Introduction: Role of the Cerebellum in Cognition and Behavior
In recent years, many developmental and neuropsychiatric disorders have been linked to dysfunction in
cerebellar circuits. At the same time, the field of cerebellar functional neuroanatomy has made rapid
progress, describing multiple interdigitated representations of both motor and non-motor functions.
These findings now open the door to much more detailed investigation of cerebellar abnormalities. This
special issue aims to bring together the most recent insights into the functional organization of the
cerebellum with cutting-edge work on dysfunction of these circuits in neurological and neuropsychiatric
diseases.
