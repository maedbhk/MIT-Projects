## Why have you chosen this topic? 
* One of the holy grail questions of cerebellar research is “what does the cerebellum do?”. 
* Many theories have been proposed attempting to answer this question. However, there has been a lot of focus on the cerebellum in its mature (adult) form, but not as much on the developing cerebellum. 
* Given our interest in the cerebellum as a powerful computational structure that subserves functions associated with cognition, language, social and emotional processes, it seems like an oversight to ignore the cerebellum during a particularly interesting period of development: the prenatal period. 
* We should care about the prenatal period for the following reasons: 
    * Cerebellum has a protracted development, which means that it does not mature until about the 11th postnatal month
    *  It is very sensitive to perturbation during this period resulting from teratogenic influences
    * There is recent evidence that discusses the unique genetic landscape of the developing cerebellum and how disruptio
    during these sensitive periods affects later developmental outcomes
* Some of the theories of cerebellar function may be better understood through the lens of the developmental period rather than the mature adult brain
* Cerebellar damage has very different outcomes depending on the stage of development and this affects how we interpret the cerebellum’s involvement in different cognitive functions. 
* Take social cognition as an example: review research on posterior fossa syndrome  

## Outline
### General Introduction
* What this review will highlight is how cerebellar maturation during the prenatal period shapes later developmental outcomes, with a specific focus on social cognition
* Highlighting papers in the past two years that bring this topic to attention, using different methodologies, from animal models to neuroimaging. 

### How does the cerebellum develop? 
* Focus on connectivity with the cerebral cortex
* Transcriptomics development
* End with protracted development of cerebellum

### Sensitive period of prenatal cerebellar development
* How this period shapes later development (what happens when things go wrong)

### Cerebellar development + prematurity
* How prematurity affects later outcomes (specific focus on the cerebellum)

### Cerebellum and abnormal social development
* Cortico-cerebellar connectivity and social cognition
* Abnormal cerebellar development in ASD

### Future Directions / Outstanding Questions
* Summary and Outlook
