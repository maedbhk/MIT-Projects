title: Cerebellum and Neuropsychiatric Disorders
---

To my knowledge, there hasnâ€™t been a study comprehensively investigating unique signatures of neuropsychiatric, neurological, and neurodevelopmental disorders in the cerebellum. There have been many piecemeal studies reporting altered [functional connectivity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158214000096) and [grey matter volume changes](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2014.00092/full) across these disorders, and some [large-scale studies](https://www.nature.com/articles/mp2017106) targeting specific disorders. However, with the availability of datasets like UK Biobank and ABCD, it is possible to investigate whether there are unique signatures in the cerebellum that can dissociate between neuropsychiatric, neurological, and neurodevelopmental disorders.

### Questions: 
* Are volume-, network-, region-, gradient-based changes in the cerebellum contributing to disease/symptom etiology that are unique from corresponding changes in the neocortex?
* Are particular regions of the cerebellum more susceptible to [brain aging](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0471-7), and how does this relate to different neuropsychiatric/neurological/neurodevelopmental disorders?
* Is there a relationship between sexual dimorphism/asymmetry and neuropsychiatric disorders in the cerebellum? 
* In predicting X disorder, how much variance is explained by unique cerebellar signatures, relative to other biomarkers (e.g., behavior, occupational history, digestive health)

## New ways of thinking about diagnosis
* [RDoC (Research domain criteria initiative)](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-funded-by-nimh/rdoc/about-rdoc): The aim is to understand the nature of mental health and illness in terms of varying degrees of dysfunction in fundamental psychological/biological system (i.e. major domains of neurobehavioral functioning), rather than within established diagnostic categories. 
* [RDoC Domains](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-funded-by-nimh/rdoc/constructs): negative valence systems, positive valence systems, cognitive systems, social processes, arousal and regulatory systems, 
* Some examples of RDoC constructs: reward responsiveness, reward prediction error, attention, perception, cognitive control, performance monitoring, social communication etc.)
* RDoC:  aims to address the heterogeneity in the current [nosology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosology) by providing a biologically-based, rather than symptom-based, framework for understanding mental disorders

## Conventional way of thinking about diagnosis: 
* Diagnosis is based on clinical observation: identifying symptoms that cluster together, determining when symptoms appear, resolve, recur, become chronic. 
* Problem: difficult to deconstruct clusters of complex behaviors and link them to neurobiological systems. 
By linking basic biological and behavioral components, it will become possible to construct valid, reliable phenotypes (measurable traits or characteristics) for mental disorders.
* Mental disorders are biological disorders involving brain circuits that implicate specific domains of cognition, emotion, or behavior.

## Questions:
To what extent are disorders characterized by UK Biobank accompanied by RDoC-like constructs and domains? How is cognitive function measured? [behavioral tasks or questionnaires].
