title: Item Analysis of Questionnaires in Healthy Brain Network
---


## Question
* How semantically similar are clinical questionnaires used to diagnose developmental disorders?

## Dataset
* [Healthy brains](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/cmi_healthy_brain_network/)
* The Child Mind Institute has launched the Healthy Brain Network, an ongoing initiative focused on creating and sharing a biobank comprised of data from 10,000 New York City area children and adolescents (ages 5-21).

* Population: ages 5-21, children who likely have one or more psychiatric symptoms
* Data collected: 
    * MRI + fMRI: movies (~10 min), predictive eye estimation regression - 3444 participants
    * Phenotypic assessment - 4080 participants
    * Physical activity
    * Behavioral measures (questionnaires)
    * Family structures (stress, trauma)
    * Substance use/addiction
    * Cognition and language tasks
    * Disorder-specific questionnaires
    * Electroencephalography
    * Digital Voice and Video Recordings
    * Genetics
    * Actigraphy
    * Cognitive Tasks (e.g., sequence learning), naturalistic stimuli
    * Eyetracking: pupil dilation and eye position
