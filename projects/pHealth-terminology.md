### Endophenotype
* intermediate phenotype - quantitative biological trait that is reliable in reflecting the function of a discrete biological system, and is reasonably heritable, and is much more closely related to the root cause of the disease than the broad clinical phenotype.
* biological or psychological phenomena of a disorder believed to be in the causal chain between genetic contributions to a disorder and diagnosable symptoms of psychopathology. 
* measurable biomarkers that are correlated with an illness, in part because of the shared underlying genetic influences.
* What conditions need to be met?
    * Associated with illness in the population
    * Heritable
    * Primarily state-independent
    * Co-segregate with illness in families 
    * Found in unaffected family members at a higher rate than general pop.
    * Examples of endophenotypes for MDD (major depressive disorder): learning/memory impairments, reduced reward functioning, increased stress sensitivity, REM sleep abnormalities, dysfunctions in serotonergic, catecholaminergic, HPA axis, corticotropin-releasing hormone systems, intracellular signal transduction measures.  

### Sources of endophenoytpes:
* Stress data - cortisol 
* arousal/attention - pupil dilation 
* Reaction time / accuracy - behavior 
* Strength - grip force
* Pulse/heart rate
* Oxygen
* Speech/voice data
* Handwriting 
* Plasma (inflammation markers)
* Saliva
* Movement - sleep cycles
* Temperature 
* Skin conductance (galvanic skin response)
* Transcriptomics
* fMRI BOLD signal
* Cortical thickness/anatomy
* Mobility data (tracked with phone)
* Internet search history (tracked with phone)
* Social media engagement (reddit, facebook etc)
* Electronic health records (hospital admissions etc.)
* Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 

### Inflammation markers
* Cytokine, chemokine, interleukin, interferon, tumor necrosis factor, colony-stimulating factor, growth factor (IGF, VEGF, NGF, FGF, TNF)
* You can assess inflammation/cytokine/chemokine factors in plasma or serum samples. 

### Polygenic risk score
* represents the total number of genetic variants that an individual has to assess their heritable risk of developing a particular disease.
