## Introduction

* another important consideration in the healthy brains network: preterm birth

* behavioral/cognitive tasks that measure: eye blink reflexes, sensory/tactile processing, timing, sensory integration, fine motor coordination,

* PROTRACTED DEVELOPMENT OF CEREBELLUM: prenatal information in the database (and early infancy) - could there be specific events (environmental, molecular etc) that resulted in disruption of cerebellar circuitry? and could disruption of the circuit at different timepoints result in different clinical outcomes? either severity of disorder or different presentation of disorder? 

* complex brain disorders with a cerebellar locus follow different developmental trajectories. 

There has been great interest recently in the idea of the cerebellum as a locus in neurodevelopmental disorders. Structural and functional abnormalities in the cerebellum are consistently reported across neurodevelopmental disorders, and in particular, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been linked to cerebellar abnormality. For example, children and adults with ASD show atypical fMRI activation of cortico-cerebellar networks during biological motion perception [Jack et al. 2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hbm.23493) and perception of social interaction [Kana et al. 2015](https://molecularautism.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13229-015-0052-x). Furthermore, behavioral studies have found that children with ASD display abnormal conditioned reponses in delayed eyeblink conditioning, a conditioning paradigm that strongly implicates the cerebellum. 




For example, [Tran et al. 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-18316-8) tested delayed eyeblink conditioning, a task which is depenedent on the cerebellum, on a group of very preterm children and adults. They found that in this group, there were significant deficits in the acquisition of conditioned responses, therefore suggesting that 'motor' cerebellar behavioral abnormalities coexist with non-motor abnormalities. 
    * children with ASD also display abnormal conditioned responses in the eyeblink conditioning paradigm
    * it has been suggested that the language and social deficits observed in children with complex disorders are a consequence of deficits in multi-sensory integration. 
    * one particular process that could be implicated in multisensory integration in children with ASD is timing. For example, this process may be impacted by a deficit in perceiving the temporal relationship between distinct sensory components of complex audio-visual stimuli such as language, and this deficit could also compound in social cognitive processes like theory of mind [Stevenensen et al. 2014](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/34/3/691.short)
