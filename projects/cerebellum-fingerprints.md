title: Cerebellar fingerprints of neurodevelopmental disorders
---

## Introduction

* another important consideration in the healthy brains network: preterm birth

* behavioral/cognitive tasks that measure: eye blink reflexes, sensory/tactile processing, timing, sensory integration, fine motor coordination,

* PROTRACTED DEVELOPMENT OF CEREBELLUM: prenatal information in the database (and early infancy) - could there be specific events (environmental, molecular etc) that resulted in disruption of cerebellar circuitry? and could disruption of the circuit at different timepoints result in different clinical outcomes? either severity of disorder or different presentation of disorder? 

* complex brain disorders with a cerebellar locus follow different developmental trajectories.
