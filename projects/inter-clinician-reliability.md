title: Inter Clinician Reliability of Clinical Assessments
---

## Background
* We live in a time where mental health disorders rank as the top contributors to the global burden of disease, and the age groups affected by these disorders are skewing increasingly younger. 
* We also know that despite the availability of many clinical assessments, the diagnosis of mental health illnesses is imperfect, varying substantially across clinical practitioners

## Research Question
* What is the inter-clinician reliability of standard diagnostic assessments?
    * In other words, if 10 clinicians use the same clinical questionnaire to diagnose a child/adolescent with a mental health disorder, how reliable is that diagnosis?

## Method
* Perform a literature review to identify the inter-clinician reliability of a set of commonly used questionnaires [available here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oTpsaq82iAugjONi0_lUt7ItuwrHqFAE/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115304373382106482578&rtpof=true&sd=true) 
* These questionnaires are administered as part of the Healthy Brain Network Initiative launched by the Child Mind Institute

## Overview of Questionnaires
* [Healthy brains](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/cmi_healthy_brain_network/)
* The Child Mind Institute has launched the Healthy Brain Network, an ongoing initiative focused on creating and sharing a biobank comprised of data from 10,000 New York City area children and adolescents (ages 5-21).

* Population: ages 5-21, children who likely have one or more psychiatric symptoms
* Data collected: 
    * MRI + fMRI: movies (~10 min), predictive eye estimation regression - 3444 participants
    * Diagnostic Assessment
    * Physical activity
    * Behavioral measures (questionnaires)
    * Family structures (stress, trauma)
    * Substance use/addiction
    * Cognition and language tasks
    * Disorder-specific questionnaires
    * Electroencephalography
    * Digital Voice and Video Recordings
    * Genetics
    * Actigraphy
    * Cognitive Tasks (e.g., sequence learning), naturalistic stimuli
    * Eyetracking: pupil dilation and eye position

## Results
* What criteria/metrics are used to assess reliability?
* Are certain questionnaires more reliable than others? 
* Why are certain questionnaires more/less reliable than others?

## Conclusion
* What inference can we make about diagnostic assessment based on the results of this review?
