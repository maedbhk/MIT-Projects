* Build computational models using clinical/other characteristics (e.g., previous hospital admissions, comorbidities, cognitive function, diagnoses, immunizations, allergies, medications, other illnesses, demographics) to identify risk predictors for self-harm.
* Based on modeling, do any significant clusters emerge that are dissociable from one another based on clinical features? 
* Can modeling reveal whether risk predictors for self-harm vary depending on certain clinical features?
* Can any of the subtypes be predicted by unique neural signatures?
