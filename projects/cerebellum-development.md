title: Cerebellum and Development
---

## Introduction
* Subdivisions of the cerebellum have distinctive developmental trajectories with more phylogenetically recent regions maturing later (Tiemeier et al. 2010)
* Why should we study the cerebellum during development: unique protracted developmental trajectories, sexual dimorphism, preferential vulnerability to environmental influences, implication in neurodevelopmental disorders. 
* Because the cerebellum reaches its peak volume later than the cerebrum [suggesting prolonged developmental course], it may be especially interesting to investigate differences in grey matter volume between cerebellum and cortex during this developmental window (across males + females too). 
* The larger size of the cerebellum in males and differences between sexes in longitudinal development may reflect sex-specific factors related to the higher risk for these disorders in males (Tiemeier et al. 2010) 
* Different cerebellar regions have distinct growth patterns with varying degrees of sexual dimorphism. Cerebellum is at adult volume in females during 7-11 years but not males (Caviness et al. 1996). 
* Males are particularly vulnerable to neurodevelopmental disorders (diagnosed at a higher rate with adhd, dyslexia etc). 

## Methods
* GAMLSS modeling as used in [brain charting paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04554-y)
* LDA (topic moddelling) as used in [endophenotyping of adhd paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-018-0179-6)
* Brain age prediction as used in [brain age paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0471-7) - gradient tree boosting

### Questions:
To what extent are disorders characterized by Healthy Brains accompanied by RDoC-like constructs and domains? How is cognitive function measured? [behavioral tasks or questionnaires]. 
* Do cerebellar anatomical differences reflect a generic developmental vulnerability or disorder-specific characteristics?
* Are different cerebellar regions affected in neurodevelopmental disorders? And do these regions align with functional networks that
are consistent with the characteristic symptoms of each disorder. 
* Are there differences in brain age across regions (functional, anatomical, network) of the cerebellum, and how does this differ across disorders?
    * The brain age paper provided some key insights across whole-brain regions but treated subcortical-cerebellum as one region, therefore, obscuring any within-cerebellum heterogeneity
