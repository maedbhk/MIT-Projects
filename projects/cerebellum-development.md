title: Cerebellum and Development
---

* Subdivisions of the cerebellum have distinctive developmental trajectories with more phylogenetically recent regions maturing later (Tiemeier et al. 2010)
* Why should we study the cerebellum during development: unique protracted developmental trajectories, sexual dimorphism, preferential vulnerability to environmental influences, implication in neurodevelopmental disorders. 
* Because the cerebellum reaches its peak volume later than the cerebrum [suggesting prolonged developmental course], it may be especially interesting to investigate differences in grey matter volume between cerebellum and cortex during this developmental window (across males + females too). 
* The larger size of the cerebellum in males and differences between sexes in longitudinal development may reflect sex-specific factors related to the higher risk for these disorders in males (Tiemeier et al. 2010) 
* Different cerebellar regions have distinct growth patterns with varying degrees of sexual dimorphism. Cerebellum is at adult volume in females during 7-11 years but not males (Caviness et al. 1996). 
* Males are particularly vulnerable to neurodevelopmental disorders (diagnosed at a higher rate with adhd, dyslexia etc). 

### Questions:
To what extent are disorders characterized by Healthy Brains accompanied by RDoC-like constructs and domains? How is cognitive function measured? [behavioral tasks or questionnaires].
