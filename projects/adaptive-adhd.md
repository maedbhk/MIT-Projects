## Questions - Child Behavior Checklist - Teacher Report Form
* What information is captured in this questionnaire? 

## Summary of cognitive performance
* **Opalina: this is a particularly important question if you want to write some code to address this question**
* Many questionnaires (e.g., measures) have a `total` score providing an overall summary of how well a participant did overall on a questionnaire
* For all of the measures that have a `total` score, how well on average are children with ADHD (across subtypes and gender) performing on these assessments compared to children without a diagnosis?
